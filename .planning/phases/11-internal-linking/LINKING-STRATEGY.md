## 4. Link Placement Guidelines

### Contextual Link Placement Rules

**DO:**
- Place links within the natural flow of content where relevant
- Use links in "Related Issues" or troubleshooting sections
- Add links where users might need additional information
- Link from symptoms to solutions
- Link from simple fixes to more advanced repairs

**DON'T:**
- Force links where they don't belong
- Use generic anchor text like "click here" or "read more"
- Add more than 5 internal links per article
- Link to unrelated content just for SEO

### Anchor Text Best Practices

**Good Anchor Text:**
- "If the problem persists, you may need to [replace your brake pads](/posts/tesla-brake-pad-replacement)"
- "A weak [12V battery](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement) can cause multiple electrical issues"
- "Check our [cabin air filter replacement guide](/posts/tesla-cabin-air-filter) first"

**Bad Anchor Text:**
- "[Click here](/posts/tesla-brake-pad-replacement) for more info"
- "Read more [here](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement)"
- "[This article](/posts/tesla-cabin-air-filter) explains it"

### Recommended Link Positions

1. **Introduction (1 link):** Context link to related prerequisite or overview
2. **Mid-Content (1-2 links):** Troubleshooting branches or alternative solutions
3. **End of Article (1-2 links):** Related maintenance or next steps

### Link Limit Per Article

| Section | Max Links | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Introduction | 1 | Context/prerequisite |
| Main Content | 2 | Troubleshooting branches |
| Conclusion | 2 | Related guides/next steps |
| **Total** | **5** | SEO optimal |

### Related Articles Section Template

Add this section at the end of each article:

```markdown
## Related Guides
