  <name>Task 1: Create topic clusters and linking matrix</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/11-internal-linking/LINKING-STRATEGY.md</files>
  <action>
Create LINKING-STRATEGY.md with the following sections:

## 1. Topic Clusters

Organize 51 articles into 10-12 topic clusters:

**Cluster 1: Charging & Range**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Charging Guide"
- Articles: charge-port-stuck, slow-charging-fix, mobile-connector-issues, supercharger-slow, range-loss-fix
- Cross-links: Each article links to 2-3 others in cluster

**Cluster 2: Brakes & Stopping**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Brake Maintenance"
- Articles: brake-pad-replacement, squeaky-brakes-fix, regen-braking-reduced, phantom-braking-fix
- Cross-links: All 4 articles interlinked

**Cluster 3: Climate & HVAC**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Climate System"
- Articles: ac-not-cooling, cabin-air-filter, heat-pump-problems, climate-keeper-issues
- Cross-links: All 4 articles interlinked

**Cluster 4: Software & Screen**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Software Issues"
- Articles: screen-black-fix, software-update-stuck, autopilot-unavailable, navigation-not-working, voice-commands-fix, mcu-touchscreen-upgrade
- Cross-links: Screen articles to MCU upgrade, software to navigation

**Cluster 5: Connectivity & Keys**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Connectivity Guide"
- Articles: bluetooth-issues, phone-key-not-working, lte-connectivity-issues, homelink-programming, key-fob-battery
- Cross-links: Phone key to bluetooth, key fob to phone key

**Cluster 6: Cameras & Recording**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Camera System"
- Articles: autopilot-camera-calibration, dashcam-not-saving, sentry-mode-not-recording, rear-camera-blurry
- Cross-links: Sentry to dashcam, autopilot cameras to calibration

**Cluster 7: Doors & Access**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Door & Entry Issues"
- Articles: door-handle-not-working, frunk-wont-open, trunk-wont-close, falcon-wing-door-fix, window-reset-calibration
- Cross-links: Door handle to frunk/trunk, falcon wing standalone

**Cluster 8: Suspension & Handling**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Suspension Guide"
- Articles: control-arm-replacement, air-suspension-issues, suspension-noise-fix, creaking-rattling-fix, wheel-alignment-diy
- Cross-links: Noise fix to control arm, alignment to suspension

**Cluster 9: Wheels & Tires**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Wheel Maintenance"
- Articles: wheel-alignment-diy, tire-rotation, aero-cap-removal
- Cross-links: Tire rotation to alignment, aero caps standalone

**Cluster 10: Exterior Care**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Paint & Body"
- Articles: headlight-condensation, paint-chip-repair, windshield-wiper-replacement, ppf-installation, ceramic-coating, door-seal-maintenance
- Cross-links: PPF to ceramic coating, paint chip to PPF

**Cluster 11: Interior & Comfort**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Interior Maintenance"
- Articles: seat-heater-fix, steering-wheel-buttons, usb-not-working, cabin-air-filter
- Cross-links: Cabin filter also in climate cluster

**Cluster 12: Battery & Electrical**
- Hub concept: "Tesla Electrical System"
- Articles: 12v-battery-replacement, key-fob-battery, gear-oil-change
- Cross-links: 12v to other electrical issues

## 2. Linking Matrix

Create a table showing recommended links for each article:

| Article | Link To (2-4 articles) | Anchor Text Examples |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| charge-port-stuck | slow-charging-fix, mobile-connector-issues | "If charging is slow even after...", "Check your mobile connector..." |
| brake-pad-replacement | squeaky-brakes-fix, regen-braking-reduced | "Still hearing noise? See our guide on...", "Also check your regen settings..." |
| ... | ... | ... |

(Complete matrix for all 51 articles)

## 3. Implementation Priority

Rank articles by traffic potential for link implementation order:
1. High-traffic articles (link first): 12v-battery, brake-pad, cabin-air-filter, charge-port
2. Medium-traffic: Most DIY guides
3. Lower priority: Niche topics (falcon-wing, air-suspension)

## 4. Link Placement Guidelines

- Place links contextually within content (not just at end)
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Limit to 3-5 internal links per article
- Prioritize links to related content readers would want next
- Add "Related Articles" section at end if natural
