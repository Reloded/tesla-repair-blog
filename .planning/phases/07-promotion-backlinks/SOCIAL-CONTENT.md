Copy-paste ready. Each under 280 characters.

**Post 1: Screen Cleaning**
```
Your Tesla screen looking cloudy? Skip the Windex.

Use a microfiber cloth + distilled water only. Glass cleaners can damage the coating.

Quick wipe, good as new.

**Post 2: 12V Battery**
```
Tesla 12V battery dying is more common than you think.

Signs: sluggish screen, door handle issues, random warnings.

Good news: you can replace it yourself in 30 min.

**Post 3: Cabin Filter**
```
When did you last change your Tesla cabin filter?

Tesla recommends every 2 years, but if you're in a dusty area, check it yearly.

Takes 10 minutes. Your lungs will thank you.

**Post 4: Tire Rotation**
```
Tesla tires wear faster than you expect (that instant torque).

Rotate every 10,000 km to extend life.

Front tires wear faster on RWD, rear on AWD. Check yours.

**Post 5: Door Handle Fix**
```
Model S door handle stuck? Before paying $500+ at service center:

Check the microswitch first. Often just needs cleaning or a $20 part.

DIY fix saves hundreds.

**Post 6: Squeaky Brakes**
```
Tesla brakes squeaking? Probably rust from regenerative braking (you barely use them).

Fix: Find an empty road and do 5-10 moderate stops.

Cleans the rust right off.

**Post 7: USB Not Working**
```
Tesla USB ports stopped working for Sentry Mode?

Try reformatting your drive to exFAT (not FAT32).

If still dead, check the USB hub - they fail sometimes.

**Post 8: Windshield Wipers**
```
Replacing Tesla wipers? You don't need Tesla-branded ones.

Bosch and Rain-X fit perfectly and cost half the price.

Just match the size for your model.

**Post 9: Frunk Won't Open**
```
Frunk won't open? Before panicking:

1. Try the app
2. Try the interior button
3. Check 12V battery

Usually it's the 12V getting weak, not the frunk motor.

**Post 10: Winter Prep**
```
Winter Tesla prep checklist:

- Check tire pressure (drops in cold)
- Precondition battery before driving
- Keep charge between 20-80%
- Cabin filter check

Your range will thank you.

## 2. Reddit Response Templates (5)

Use these when you see relevant questions. Always provide the helpful answer first.

### Template 1: 12V Battery Questions

**Use when someone asks about:** random errors, sluggish screen, door issues, "my Tesla won't wake up"

```
This sounds like classic 12V battery symptoms. Even though Teslas have a big
main battery, they still use a small 12V for the computers and accessories.

Signs it's going bad:
- Slow/laggy touchscreen
- Door handles not presenting
- Random warning messages
- Car won't "wake up" from app

The good news: you can replace it yourself. It's behind a panel in the frunk
(Model 3/Y) or under the rear seat (Model S/X). Takes about 30 minutes.

Cost: $80-150 for an AGM battery vs $200+ at service center.

What model do you have? I can point you to the right process.

### Template 2: Cabin Filter Questions

**Use when someone asks about:** AC smell, musty odor, air quality, filter replacement

```
The cabin air filter is probably due for a change. Tesla says every 2 years,
but I do mine yearly (dusty area).

The smell usually means either:
1. Filter is clogged/moldy
2. AC evaporator needs cleaning

Start with the filter - it's a 10-15 minute job on Model 3/Y. You'll need
a T20 Torx and a new filter ($20-40 on Amazon).

The filter is behind the glovebox. Pop out the glovebox, and you'll see the
filter housing. Swap it out.

If the smell persists after the filter, the evaporator might need a spray
treatment, but try the filter first.
```

### Template 3: Screen Issues

**Use when someone asks about:** screen glitches, unresponsive touch, yellow border, cleaning

```
A few things to check depending on what's happening:

**If laggy/glitchy:** Try a soft reset first - hold both scroll wheels for
10 seconds until the screen goes black. This fixes 90% of software weirdness.

**If touch unresponsive in spots:** Could be the screen itself failing, but
first try cleaning it properly. Use only microfiber + distilled water.
Glass cleaners can damage the oleophobic coating.

**If yellow border appearing:** That's adhesive degradation. Common on older
Model S/X screens. Tesla has replaced these under warranty for some owners,
worth asking service.

What specifically is your screen doing?
```

### Template 4: Tire/Wheel Questions

**Use when someone asks about:** tire wear, rotation, replacement, wheel curb rash

```
Tesla tires wear faster than most people expect - that instant torque is fun
but hard on rubber.

A few things:

**Rotation:** Every 10,000 km (6,000 miles). Front wears faster on RWD, rear
on AWD. Helps even out the wear significantly.

**Replacement:** You don't need Tesla tires. Any tire shop can do it. Just
make sure they know to use jack pucks (Tesla's aluminum battery casing can
dent if lifted wrong). Most shops have them now.

**Cost savings:** Costco and Discount Tire usually beat Tesla service pricing
by 20-30% for the same tires.

What model/year do you have? That affects which tires fit.
```

### Template 5: General DIY Encouragement

**Use when someone asks:** "Can I do this myself?" or "Is this hard to fix?"

```
You can definitely do this yourself if you're comfortable with basic tools.

Teslas are actually easier to work on than most cars for a lot of things:
- No engine means more accessible components
- Good online community with tutorials
- Many parts available on Amazon/eBay

The main things I'd still take to service:
- Anything involving the high-voltage battery
- Suspension work (needs calibration)
- Safety recalls

But filters, 12V battery, interior trim, basic maintenance - all very
DIY-friendly.

What specifically are you looking to tackle? Happy to point you in the
right direction.

## 3. Forum Introduction Post

Use this when joining Tesla Motors Club or similar forums.

```
Hello everyone!

Just joined the forum and wanted to introduce myself.

I'm a Tesla owner from Lithuania - been driving a Model 3 for a few years now.
I'm mostly self-taught when it comes to repairs, learning from YouTube, forums
like this one, and a lot of trial and error.

I started documenting my repairs and maintenance work on a blog
(tesladiyrepair.com) to help other owners who want to DIY. Covers things like
12V battery replacement, cabin filters, common fixes - stuff that doesn't
really need a service center visit.

Looking forward to learning from this community and hopefully contributing
some useful info along the way. Always happy to share what's worked for me
or hear better approaches.

Cheers!
