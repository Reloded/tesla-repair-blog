# Tesla DIY Repair Blog - Promotion Strategy

Your site: **https://tesladiyrepair.com**
Your background: Self-taught Tesla mechanic from Lithuania

## 1. Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Best For | Rules to Know |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| r/TeslaMotors | 2M+ | General Tesla news, questions | No self-promotion, be helpful first |
| r/TeslaModel3 | 500k+ | Model 3 specific issues | Technical help welcome |
| r/TeslaModelY | 200k+ | Model Y specific issues | Same as Model 3 |
| r/TeslaLounge | 100k+ | Casual Tesla discussion | More relaxed, still no spam |
| r/electricvehicles | 500k+ | Broader EV community | Tesla repair content fits well |

### Karma Building Strategy (Do This First!)

Before sharing any links, build reputation:

1. **Week 1-2:** Comment helpfully on 5-10 posts per day
   - Answer repair questions from experience
   - Share tips WITHOUT linking to your site
   - Be genuinely helpful

2. **Week 3-4:** Continue commenting, start saving good questions
   - Note common questions you could answer with articles
   - Build relationships with regular posters

3. **Week 5+:** Occasionally share links ONLY when directly helpful
   - Someone asks exact question your article answers
   - Never post "check out my site"
   - Always provide the answer IN the comment, link is bonus

### When to Share Links

**DO share when:**
- Someone asks a specific question your article answers completely
- You're providing the answer in your comment AND offering more detail
- The link genuinely helps (not just drives traffic)

**DON'T share when:**
- Creating a post just to share your link
- The question is only loosely related
- You've already shared a link recently in that subreddit
- You're commenting just to drop a link

### Example Comment Pattern

```
Great question! I've dealt with this exact issue on my Model 3.

[Provide the actual helpful answer here - 2-3 paragraphs]

If you want more details on the tools needed and step-by-step photos,
I wrote up my process here: [link] - but the summary above should
get you started.
```

## 2. Tesla Forums Strategy

### Tesla Motors Club (TMC) - teslamotorsclub.com

**The largest Tesla forum.** Very knowledgeable community, suspicious of spammers.

**Approach:**
1. Create account with real name/username
2. Fill out profile completely (location, car model, ownership date)
3. Spend 2-3 weeks just reading and occasionally commenting
4. Build post count to 20+ before any link sharing
5. Add site to forum signature (allowed after certain post count)

**Forum Signature Example:**
```
Tesla DIY Repair Guides | tesladiyrepair.com
Model 3 owner since 2022 | Lithuania
```

### Tesla Owners Online - teslaownersonline.com

Smaller community, similar rules. Good for Model S/X content.

### General Forum Rules

- Read the FAQ and rules before posting
- Introduce yourself in the introductions thread
- Never create threads just to promote
- Let your signature do the passive promotion
- Be the helpful expert, not the marketer

## 3. Social Media Presence

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Profile Setup:**
- Username: @TeslaDIYRepair (or similar available)

**Profile Bio Template:**
```
