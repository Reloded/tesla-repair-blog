# Tesla DIY Repair Blog

## What This Is

A content-driven affiliate website providing DIY repair guides for Tesla owners. Monetized through Amazon.de Associates program, targeting the European Tesla community with practical how-to articles that recommend tools and parts.

## Core Value

**Professional brand that builds trust** — visitors must see this as a credible, authoritative resource they'd bookmark and return to, not a throwaway affiliate site.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Static blog with 11 Tesla repair articles — existing
- ✓ Amazon.de affiliate integration (tag: diyrepair-21) — existing
- ✓ Eleventy static site generator with Nunjucks templates — existing
- ✓ Netlify hosting with GitHub auto-deploy — existing
- ✓ RSS feed and XML sitemap — existing
- ✓ Mobile-responsive design — existing

### Active

- [ ] Custom domain name (professional URL)
- [ ] Logo and brand identity
- [ ] Polished visual design
- [ ] SEO optimization for Google rankings
- [ ] More repair guides (expand content library)
- [ ] Google Analytics tracking (replace placeholder)
- [ ] Additional revenue streams beyond Amazon
- [ ] Email newsletter signup
- [ ] Favicon and Open Graph images

### Out of Scope

- Video content (YouTube/TikTok) — focus on written guides first
- Paid products (ebooks, courses) — build audience first
- Community features (forums, comments, accounts) — adds complexity
- Multiple languages — English/German coverage sufficient for now

## Context

**Background:**
- Owner is self-taught Tesla automechanic from Lithuania
- Goal: $1000/month passive income
- Available time: evenings and weekends
- Technical: can manage site updates, comfortable with code

- Clean architecture, easy to extend

## Constraints

- **Budget**: ~$100/month — domain, hosting, tools must fit within this
- **Time**: Limited to evenings/weekends — automation preferred over manual tasks
- **Technical**: Must be self-manageable — no complex infrastructure requiring devops

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Eleventy for static site | Simple, fast, free hosting | ✓ Good |
| Amazon.de affiliates | User is in Lithuania, EU market | — Pending |
| Netlify hosting | Free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub | ✓ Good |
