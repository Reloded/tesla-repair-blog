  <h1>About Tesla DIY Repair</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Tesla DIY Repair, a resource for Tesla owners who want to save money by handling their own maintenance and repairs.</p>

  <h2>Who I Am</h2>

  <p>I'm an independent, self-taught Tesla mechanic. I've been working on Teslas since 2018, learning through hands-on experience, service manuals, and a lot of trial and error. I don't work for Tesla—I run my own shop and work on Teslas every day.</p>

  <p>Before Teslas, I worked on traditional cars for years. When EVs started becoming popular, I saw an opportunity: Tesla service centers are expensive, often booked weeks out, and many repairs are simple enough to do at home. But the information wasn't easy to find.</p>

  <p>That's why I started this site—to share what I've learned and help other Tesla owners save money.</p>

  <h2>Why DIY?</h2>

  <p>Here's the reality of Tesla ownership:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service centers are expensive</strong> — $150-200/hour labor rates</li>
    <li><strong>Appointments are hard to get</strong> — Often 2-4 weeks out</li>
    <li><strong>Many repairs are simple</strong> — Things like filters, wipers, and 12V batteries take minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Parts are available</strong> — Unlike early Tesla days, parts are now widely available online</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By learning to do basic maintenance yourself, you can save hundreds to thousands of dollars per year—and you'll understand your car better.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step-by-step repair guides</strong> — Written for beginners with clear instructions</li>
    <li><strong>Tool recommendations</strong> — What you actually need (and what you don't)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost comparisons</strong> — DIY vs. Tesla service vs. independent shops</li>
    <li><strong>Honest assessments</strong> — I'll tell you when a job is too complex for DIY</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>

  <p><strong>Safety first.</strong> If a repair is safety-critical or beyond your skill level, I'll say so. Some things—like high-voltage battery work—should only be done by trained professionals.</p>

  <p><strong>Quality matters.</strong> Cheap parts often lead to repeat repairs. I recommend parts I'd use on my own vehicles.</p>

  <p><strong>Anyone can learn.</strong> I was a complete beginner once. With the right guidance and patience, most people can handle basic car maintenance.</p>
