  - q: "When will Tesla FSD be available in Europe?"
    a: "Tesla expects to begin rolling out FSD (Supervised) in Europe in early 2026, pending final regulatory approvals. Elon Musk stated at Davos in January 2026 that approval could come as early as February 2026. The rollout will likely be phased, starting with individual countries like the Netherlands and Sweden before expanding across the EU."
  - q: "Will European FSD be the same as US FSD?"
    a: "Not initially. The European version will likely launch with some restrictions due to EU regulations. Features like automatic lane changes may require explicit driver confirmation at first. Over time, as Tesla collects regional driving data and regulators gain confidence, features should converge with the US version."
  - q: "How much will FSD cost in Europe?"
    a: "Tesla is moving to a subscription-only model globally. In the US, FSD currently costs $99/month (or $49/month for cars with Enhanced Autopilot). European pricing hasn't been confirmed yet but is expected to be similar. The one-time purchase option ($8,000 in the US) is being discontinued on February 14, 2026."
  - q: "Do I need any hardware upgrades for FSD in Europe?"
    a: "All Tesla vehicles built from 2021 onwards have the required Hardware 3 (HW3) or Hardware 4 (HW4) computer. If you have an older vehicle with HW2.5, you'll need a computer upgrade (around €1,500 at a Tesla Service Center). All vision-based Teslas (no radar) are FSD-compatible."

After years of waiting, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system is finally on the verge of launching in Europe. Elon Musk confirmed at the World Economic Forum in Davos (January 2026) that regulatory approval could come as early as February 2026 — and real progress is happening fast.

Here's what you actually need to know as a European Tesla owner.

## What Is FSD (Supervised)?

Let's clear up the naming confusion first. Tesla's driver assistance tiers have shifted significantly:

**Basic Autopilot** (being discontinued):
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC)
- Autosteer (lane keeping)
- Tesla removed this from new US/Canada vehicles in January 2026 — new cars there now only come with basic cruise control
- **European Tesla buyers still get Basic Autopilot included as of early 2026**

**Enhanced Autopilot** (where available):
- Everything in Basic Autopilot
- Navigate on Autopilot (highway)
- Auto Lane Change
- Autopark
- Summon

**Full Self-Driving (Supervised)** — the big one:
- Everything above, plus
- City street navigation — the car handles intersections, traffic lights, stop signs, roundabouts
- Automatic turns and lane changes on city roads
- Speed profile adjustments based on road type
- Arrival options (park curbside, in a lot, or in a driveway)
- Still requires **driver supervision at all times** — hands on wheel, eyes on road

The "Supervised" part matters. This is not a robotaxi. You are legally and practically responsible for the car at all times. FSD handles the driving tasks, you handle the oversight.

## EU Regulatory Status: Where Things Stand

Getting FSD approved in Europe has been a long, slow process. Here's why, and where things are now:

### The Problem: UNECE Regulations

Unlike the US where Tesla could ship FSD and iterate, Europe requires **pre-approval** under UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) regulations. Specifically:

- **UN Regulation 79** governs automatic steering — previously limited automatic steering to speeds under 10 km/h for parking, and lane-keeping only on highways
- **UN Regulation 157 (ALKS)** covers automated lane-keeping systems but was designed for highway-only, Level 3 autonomy — not what FSD does

Tesla's FSD doesn't fit neatly into either box. It's a Level 2+ system (driver always supervises) that works everywhere — highways, city streets, residential areas.

### The Breakthrough: New UNECE Draft Regulation

In late January 2026, the UNECE Working Party adopted a **new draft regulation on Automated Driving Systems**. This is massive because:

- It creates a standardized framework for validating vehicles with autonomous features
- It covers both supervised (like FSD Supervised) and unsupervised systems
- The draft will be submitted for formal approval in **June 2026**
- It could enter into force immediately upon approval

### What's Happening Right Now

- **Netherlands (RDW)**: Tesla has filed with the Dutch Vehicle Authority, which handles EU type approvals for many automakers
- **Sweden**: Tesla received approval to test FSD Supervised on Swedish public roads (January 2026)
- **Davos announcement**: Musk stated approval expected "as early as next month" (February 2026) at the World Economic Forum

The likely path: Tesla gets initial approval through the Netherlands (RDW), then other EU countries recognize this type approval and allow FSD within their borders. Expect a **phased rollout across 2026**, not a sudden continent-wide launch.

## How FSD Works Day-to-Day

If you've only used Autopilot on European highways, FSD is a step change. Here's what changes in practice:

### Activating FSD
1. Set your destination in navigation
2. Pull the drive stalk down twice (or press the Autopilot button on the steering wheel)
3. FSD takes over — steering, acceleration, braking, lane changes, turns

### What FSD Handles
- **Intersections**: Stops at red lights and stop signs, proceeds when clear
- **Turns**: Makes left and right turns based on your navigation route
- **Roundabouts**: Enters, navigates, and exits (this is a big one for Europe)
- **Lane changes**: Signals and changes lanes to follow your route or pass slower traffic
- **Speed adaptation**: Slows for school zones, residential areas, curves
- **Pedestrians and cyclists**: Detects and yields appropriately

### What You Still Do
- Keep your hands on the wheel (the car monitors this via torque sensors)
- Watch the road at all times (cabin camera monitors driver attention)
- Be ready to take over instantly — especially in construction zones, unusual intersections, and bad weather
- Use the turn signal to suggest lane changes, or override by steering

### European-Specific Considerations
The European version will likely have some differences from the US version at launch:

- **Lane change confirmation**: EU regulations may require you to confirm automatic lane changes (tap the stalk) rather than having the car change lanes autonomously
- **Speed limits**: Stricter adherence to posted speed limits — less aggressive than US behavior
- **Mapping data**: FSD will need to build up European road data. Early users should expect it to be less polished on unfamiliar roads
- **Right-hand traffic optimization**: The core FSD model handles both left and right-hand traffic, but fine-tuning for European road designs (roundabouts, narrow streets, different lane markings) will improve over time

## Pricing: Subscription Is the Future

Tesla is making a major shift in how FSD is sold:

### Current US Pricing (Expected European Baseline)
- **FSD Subscription**: $99/month (~€95/month estimated)
- **FSD with Enhanced Autopilot**: $49/month (if your car already has EAP)
- **One-time purchase**: $8,000 — **being discontinued February 14, 2026**

### What This Means for Europe
- When FSD launches in Europe, it will almost certainly be **subscription-only**
- European pricing may differ slightly due to VAT and regional adjustments
- Existing Enhanced Autopilot owners might get a discounted subscription rate
- Musk has confirmed subscription prices will increase over time as capabilities improve

### Is It Worth It?
That depends on your driving. If you do long commutes through city traffic daily, FSD could be a sanity saver. If you mostly drive highways where Autopilot already works well, the value proposition is less clear at launch.

The subscription model is nice because you can try it for a month and cancel — no commitment.

## Hardware Requirements

Not sure if your Tesla can run FSD? Here's the breakdown:

| Hardware | FSD Compatible? | Found In |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| HW2.5 | ❌ Needs upgrade | Pre-2019 vehicles |
| HW3 (FSD Computer) | ✅ Yes | 2019-2023 vehicles |
| HW4 (AI4) | ✅ Yes | 2024+ vehicles |

**How to check your hardware:**
1. Go to **Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information**
2. Look for "Full Self-Driving Computer" or check your computer type
3. If unsure, schedule a service appointment — Tesla can check and upgrade if needed

HW3 to HW4 upgrades aren't required for FSD but may become available (and eventually necessary) as Tesla advances the system.

## Safety: Be Realistic

FSD (Supervised) has improved dramatically in the US, earning MotorTrend's Best Tech 2026 award. But be honest with yourself:

- **It's not perfect.** FSD can make mistakes, especially in unfamiliar situations
- **European roads are different.** Narrow streets, aggressive cyclists, tram tracks, unusual traffic patterns — early FSD in Europe will have a learning curve
- **Weather matters.** Heavy rain, snow on road markings, and low sun can degrade camera performance
- **You are the backup.** Legally and practically, every FSD trip requires an attentive driver

The best approach: treat FSD as a very capable co-pilot, not a chauffeur. Stay engaged, enjoy the reduced fatigue, but keep your hands ready.

## What to Do Now

If you're a European Tesla owner excited about FSD, here's your checklist:

1. **Check your hardware** — make sure you have HW3 or newer (see above)
2. **Update your software** — keep your car on the latest firmware version
3. **Clean your cameras** — FSD relies entirely on cameras. Keep them spotless ([see our camera calibration guide](/posts/tesla-autopilot-camera-calibration/))
4. **Watch for the OTA update** — when FSD launches in your country, it'll arrive as an over-the-air software update
5. **Budget for the subscription** — expect roughly €99/month, with the option to cancel anytime
6. **Follow Tesla's regional announcements** — rollout will be country-by-country

## The Bottom Line

FSD coming to Europe in 2026 is genuinely exciting. After years of being stuck with basic Autopilot while US owners got city-street navigation, the gap is finally closing.

Will it be perfect on day one? No. European roads, regulations, and driving styles will take time to fully optimize for. But the underlying technology — Tesla's vision-based neural networks — has proven itself across billions of miles in North America.

The subscription model means there's zero risk in trying it. When it drops in your country, sign up for a month, see how it handles your daily routes, and decide from there.

Welcome to the future. It's supervised, but it's here.
