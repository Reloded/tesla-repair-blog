Does your Tesla frunk hood sag when you open it? Maybe it no longer stays up on its own, or slowly drifts down and threatens to bonk your head? That's a clear sign your frunk struts are worn out—and it's an easy fix you can do yourself in under 30 minutes.

**The good news:** Frunk struts are cheap (€30-50 for a pair) and the replacement requires minimal tools. Tesla service centers will charge you €150+ for this simple job.

## How Frunk Struts Work

Frunk struts (also called gas struts, gas springs, or lift supports) are pressurized cylinders filled with nitrogen gas. When you open the frunk, the gas pressure extends the strut and holds the hood up. Over time, the seals wear out, gas escapes, and the strut loses its lifting power.

**Expected lifespan:** 3-7 years depending on usage and climate. Cold weather and frequent use shorten lifespan.

## Signs Your Frunk Struts Need Replacement

- **Frunk doesn't stay fully open** — the most obvious sign
- **Hood slowly drops down** after opening
- **Need to prop it open** with a stick or your hand
- **Frunk feels "heavy"** when opening — no assist from the struts
- **Oil residue** visible on the strut cylinder (internal seal failure)
- **Squeaking or creaking** when opening/closing

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Test your struts:</strong> Open the frunk and let go. Good struts should hold the hood up firmly with zero movement. If it drops even slightly, replacement time is approaching.
</div>

## What You'll Need

This is a genuinely simple repair. You'll need:

- Replacement struts (always replace as a pair)
- 10mm socket or wrench
- Flathead screwdriver or plastic pry tool
- About 20-30 minutes

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Always replace both struts together.</strong> If one is worn, the other isn't far behind. Mismatched struts can cause uneven stress on the hinges.
</div>

### Strut Specifications by Model

**Model 3 / Model Y:**
- Length: ~370mm (14.6") extended
- Force: ~150-200N per strut
- Mounting: Ball stud on both ends

**Model S:**
- Length: ~450mm extended
- Force: ~250-300N per strut (heavier aluminum hood)
- Mounting: Ball stud on both ends

**Model X:**
- Similar to Model S
- Note: Falcon wing doors have separate struts—this guide is for the front trunk only

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Buying tip:</strong> Aftermarket struts from reputable brands (Sachs, Stabilus) work just as well as OEM and cost 50-70% less. Avoid ultra-cheap eBay struts—they often fail within a year.
</div>

## Step-by-Step Replacement Guide

### Model 3 and Model Y

The process is identical for both vehicles since they share the same frunk design.

**Step 1: Open and Secure the Frunk**

1. Open the frunk fully
2. Have a helper hold the hood, OR prop it with a padded stick/pole
3. Never work under an unsupported hood with weak struts

**Step 2: Locate the Struts**

The struts are on either side of the frunk opening, connecting the body to the underside of the hood. Each strut has:
- **Lower mount:** Attached to the body
- **Upper mount:** Attached to the hood

**Step 3: Remove the Old Struts**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Remove one strut at a time.</strong> This keeps the hood partially supported during the swap.
</div>

For each strut:

1. **Start with the upper mount (hood end)**
   - Look for a small metal clip holding the ball socket onto the ball stud
   - Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully pry off the retaining clip
   - Pop the socket off the ball stud (may require some wiggling)

2. **Move to the lower mount (body end)**
   - Same process: remove clip, pop off socket
   - The strut is now free

3. **Repeat for the second strut**

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take a photo of the strut orientation before removal. While it's hard to install backwards, knowing the original position helps.
</div>

**Step 4: Install the New Struts**

Install in reverse order:

1. **Attach lower mount first** (body side)
   - Press the ball socket firmly onto the ball stud
   - You should hear/feel it snap into place
   - Install the retaining clip

2. **Attach upper mount** (hood side)
   - May need to push the hood down slightly to align
   - Press socket onto ball stud
   - Install retaining clip

3. **Repeat for the second strut**

**Step 5: Test the Repair**

1. Remove your prop/helper
2. Close the frunk completely
3. Open the frunk using the button or app
4. The hood should spring up and stay in place firmly
5. Test a few times to ensure both struts are secure

### Model S

The Model S frunk is larger and uses stronger struts, but the replacement process is similar:

**Key differences:**
- Struts are longer and higher force
- May have different mounting hardware on older models
- Some Model S variants have strut covers that need removal first

1. Open frunk and secure with a prop
2. If present, remove any plastic trim covering the strut mounts
3. Remove retaining clips and pop off both ends of each strut
4. Install new struts, lower mount first
5. Replace any trim pieces removed
6. Test operation

### Model X

The Model X front trunk follows the same general process as Model S. Note that the Falcon Wing door struts are a completely different (and more complex) repair—this guide covers only the front trunk.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Working under an unsupported hood** — Weak struts can give way suddenly
2. **Replacing only one strut** — Always do both for even support
3. **Forcing the socket** — If it won't pop off easily, make sure the clip is fully removed
4. **Losing the retaining clips** — They're small and springy; work over a tray
5. **Installing struts backward** — Most struts should be mounted piston rod (narrow end) DOWN to keep the seal lubricated

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Piston orientation:</strong> For longest strut life, mount with the narrow rod end pointing down. This keeps oil on the seal. Most Tesla struts come this way from factory.
</div>

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | €150-250 | Parts + labor |
| Third-party Shop | €80-150 | Depends on location |
| DIY (Aftermarket struts) | €30-50 | OEM-equivalent quality |
| DIY (OEM struts) | €50-80 | Genuine Tesla parts |

**Savings: €100-200** by doing this 30-minute job yourself.

## How to Extend Strut Life

While struts are wear items, you can maximize their lifespan:

- **Don't slam the frunk** — Let it close under its own weight
- **Clean the rod occasionally** — Wipe with a damp cloth to remove grit
- **Garage when possible** — Extreme temperature swings stress the seals
- **Open fully before loading** — Partial opening puts stress on the struts

## When to Get Professional Help

This repair is straightforward, but consider professional help if:

- Your frunk was damaged in an accident (alignment issues)
- The ball studs are damaged or worn (the car side, not the strut)
- You notice hinge problems beyond just the struts
- You're uncomfortable working on your car

## Troubleshooting

**New struts don't hold the hood up:**
- Verify you installed the correct struts for your model
- Check that both sockets are fully seated on the ball studs
- Some aftermarket struts need a few open/close cycles to "break in"

**Frunk still won't open easily:**
- This is usually a latch issue, not struts. See our [frunk won't open guide](/posts/tesla-frunk-wont-open/)

**One side feels stronger than the other:**
- Normal if struts are different brands/ages
- If new struts, one may be defective—contact the seller
