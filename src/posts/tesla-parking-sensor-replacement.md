A parking sensor stops working and suddenly your Tesla is beeping nonstop every time you reverse, or it's showing a persistent "Parking Assist Degraded" warning on the touchscreen. Tesla service centers charge anywhere from $300 to over $2,000 for this repair depending on whether the bumper needs to come off and how many sensors are damaged.

The sensor itself costs about $20-50 from aftermarket suppliers. The actual replacement takes 15-30 minutes in most cases. Here's how to do it yourself.

## Understanding Tesla's Parking Sensors

Tesla vehicles built before late 2022 use ultrasonic parking sensors (USS) — small circular sensors embedded in the front and rear bumpers. There are typically 12 sensors total: 6 in the front bumper and 6 in the rear.

These sensors send out ultrasonic pulses and measure the time it takes for the sound to bounce back. That's how your Tesla detects objects when parking and shows the proximity visualization on the touchscreen.

**Important note about newer Teslas:** Starting in late 2022, Tesla began removing ultrasonic sensors from new vehicles as part of the "Tesla Vision" approach, relying entirely on cameras. If your Tesla was built after October 2022, it likely doesn't have USS sensors at all. You can check by looking at the bumper — the sensors are small circular discs about 18mm in diameter, usually color-matched to the body.

### Sensor Positions

Tesla labels the sensors S1 through S12:

- **S1-S6:** Front bumper (S1 and S6 are the outermost, S3 and S4 are the innermost near the center)
- **S7-S12:** Rear bumper (same layout — outer to inner)

The inner and outer sensors use slightly different mounting but the sensor unit itself is the same part.

## Common Parking Sensor Problems

### 1. Sensor Pushed Into the Bumper

This is the most common issue. Something bumps the sensor — a shopping cart, a parking bollard, a pressure washer — and the sensor gets pushed inward behind the bumper fascia. It's still physically intact but no longer flush with the surface, so it can't detect anything properly.

**Symptoms:**
- Constant beeping when in Reverse or pulling into a parking space
- "Parking Assist Degraded" warning on touchscreen
- One section of the parking visualization shows no data

**The fix is often simple:** You can sometimes push the sensor back into place from behind the bumper without removing anything. On the Model 3 and Model Y rear bumper, you can reach behind the bumper liner. On the front, you may need to remove the front undertray (a few push clips) to access the sensors from behind.

### 2. Sensor Physically Damaged or Cracked

If the sensor face is cracked or the housing is broken, it needs to be replaced. This happens from impacts, rock chips, or aggressive pressure washing.

### 3. Sensor Gives False Readings

The sensor detects objects that aren't there, or shows incorrect distances. This can be caused by:

- Ice or snow buildup on the sensor face
- Dirt or mud caked over the sensor
- Water intrusion into the sensor housing
- Internal failure of the piezoelectric element

Try cleaning the sensor face first. A damp microfiber cloth is all you need. If cleaning doesn't fix it, the sensor needs replacement.

### 4. Wiring or Connector Issue

Less common, but the sensor connector can corrode or the wiring harness can be damaged — especially on Model S and Model X where the front bumper sees more road spray. Check the connector before buying a new sensor.

## Part Numbers

Tesla parking sensors use the base part number **1127503**. The suffix indicates the color:

| Color | Part Number Suffix |
|-------|-------------------|
| Pearl White | 1127503-00-x |
| Solid Black | 1127503-01-x |
| Midnight Silver | 1127503-12-x |
| Deep Blue | 1127503-08-x |
| Red Multi-Coat | 1127503-11-x |
| MSM (Quicksilver) | 1127503-14-x |

The last letter (C, D, etc.) indicates the revision — later revisions are generally compatible.

**Aftermarket sensors** are available on Amazon and AliExpress for $15-50 each (or packs of 4 for $40-60). They come in various colors. OEM sensors from Tesla parts suppliers like stock-tesla.com run $50-100 each.

**Should you buy OEM or aftermarket?** For something this simple, aftermarket works fine. The sensor is a standard ultrasonic transducer. The main thing to verify is the connector matches — the 1127503 part number uses a standard Tesla USS connector that aftermarket copies replicate.

## Tools You'll Need

- **Trim removal tools** — plastic pry tools for removing push clips and bumper fasteners
- **10mm socket** (for front undertray bolts on Model 3/Y)
- **Microfiber towels** — to protect the bumper paint
- **Replacement sensor(s)** — see part numbers above

That's it. No special Tesla diagnostic tools are required for the physical replacement. However, after replacement you may need to run a calibration routine through the touchscreen (more on this below).

## Step-by-Step: Replacing a Rear Bumper Sensor (Model 3/Y)

The rear bumper is the easiest access point on Model 3 and Model Y.

### Step 1: Access the Sensor From Behind

Open the trunk. Remove the trunk floor panel and the rear trunk liner to expose the back of the rear bumper. On the Model 3, the trunk liner is held by push clips — use a trim tool to pop them out.

You should be able to see the back of the sensors and their wiring connectors through the gap between the bumper fascia and the body.

### Step 2: Disconnect the Sensor

Each sensor has a small electrical connector. Press the release tab and pull the connector straight out. Be gentle — the connectors are small and the tabs can break if you force them.

### Step 3: Remove the Old Sensor

The sensor is held in the bumper by a rubber grommet that friction-fits into the bumper hole. From behind, push the sensor forward — it should pop out through the front of the bumper. If it's stuck, gently pry around the edges with a plastic trim tool.

If the sensor was pushed inward (the "pushed in" problem), it may already be loose behind the bumper.

### Step 4: Install the New Sensor

Push the new sensor into the bumper hole from the outside. The rubber grommet should seat firmly in the hole. Make sure the sensor is oriented correctly — there's usually a small notch or arrow on the sensor body indicating the "up" direction.

Push it until it's flush with the bumper surface. It should click or seat firmly.

### Step 5: Reconnect the Wiring

Plug the electrical connector back in until it clicks. Give it a gentle tug to make sure it's seated.

### Step 6: Test

Put the car in Reverse and check the parking visualization on the touchscreen. The replaced sensor should show up and detect objects normally.

## Step-by-Step: Replacing a Front Bumper Sensor (Model 3/Y)

Front sensors are slightly harder to access because of the front undertray.

### Step 1: Remove the Front Undertray

The Model 3/Y front undertray (the plastic panel under the front bumper) is held by push clips and a few 10mm bolts. Remove these and lower the panel. This gives you access to the back of the front bumper.

### Step 2: Locate and Replace the Sensor

The process is the same as the rear — disconnect the connector, push out the old sensor, push in the new one, reconnect.

### Step 3: Reinstall the Undertray

Push clips back in, tighten the 10mm bolts. Don't overtighten — they thread into plastic.

## After Replacement: Calibration

In most cases, the new sensor works immediately after plugging it in. The car detects the sensor on the USS bus and starts using it.

However, if you get a persistent "Parking Assist Degraded" warning after replacement, you may need to:

1. **Power cycle the car:** Go to Controls > Safety > Power Off on the touchscreen. Wait 2-3 minutes. Open the door to wake the car back up.
2. **Check for software updates:** Newer firmware versions can sometimes resolve sensor communication issues.
3. **Drive for a few minutes:** Some owners report the system needs a short drive to recalibrate.

If the warning persists after all of this, the sensor may need to be calibrated using Tesla's Toolbox diagnostic software — which unfortunately requires service center access. This is rare with a straightforward sensor swap, but it can happen, especially on Model S and Model X vehicles.

## Model S and Model X Notes

The sensor part numbers are the same across models (1127503 series). The main difference is access:

- **Model S:** Front sensors require removing the front bumper fascia lower section or reaching through the wheel well liner. More involved but still doable.
- **Model X:** Similar to Model S. The falcon wing doors don't affect rear sensor access.
- **Older vehicles** (pre-2016 Model S) may use an earlier sensor revision — check your existing sensor's part number before ordering.

## When to Skip DIY

Go to a service center (or a Tesla-experienced body shop) if:

- **Multiple sensors are damaged** along with bumper damage — you might need bumper repair/replacement anyway
- **The wiring harness is damaged** — splicing Tesla harnesses requires care to maintain waterproofing
- **The bumper fascia is cracked** at the sensor mounting point — the new sensor won't seat properly
- **You're under warranty** — parking sensor failure is covered under the basic vehicle warranty (4 years / 50,000 miles)

## Cost Comparison

| | Tesla Service | Independent Shop | DIY |
|--|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| Sensor (each) | $75-150 | $50-100 | $15-50 |
| Labor | $200-500+ | $100-200 | Free |
| Bumper R&R (if needed) | $500-1,500 | $200-500 | Free |
| **Total** | **$300-2,100+** | **$150-500** | **$15-50** |

The Tesla service center cost varies wildly because they often quote the full bumper removal procedure even when it's not strictly necessary. If only one sensor needs swapping and the bumper isn't damaged, you're looking at a 20-minute job and a $20 part.
