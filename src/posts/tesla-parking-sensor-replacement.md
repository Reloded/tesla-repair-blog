Tesla parking sensors (USS - Ultrasonic Sensors) can fail due to impacts, water damage, or simply age. When one fails, Tesla service quotes **$300 or more** for the repair. The good news? The sensor itself costs around **$30-50**, and you can replace it yourself in about 30 minutes.

## Symptoms of a Failed Parking Sensor

- **"Parking sensors unavailable"** message
- **Constant beeping** when parking (phantom obstacles)
- **No beeping** when approaching objects
- **Autopilot/FSD issues** (sensors contribute to safety systems)
- **Visible damage** to sensor (cracks, chips, pushed in)

The car's diagnostic system can often identify which specific sensor has failed. Check under **Controls > Service > Parking Sensors** or use a third-party OBD reader.

## Parking Sensor Locations

### Model 3 / Model Y Front Bumper
- 4 sensors across the front bumper
- 2 inner sensors (closer to center)
- 2 outer sensors (near corners)

### Model 3 / Model Y Rear Bumper
- 4 sensors across the rear bumper
- Same inner/outer arrangement

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Identifying the Failed Sensor:</strong> The diagnostic screen usually shows which sensor is malfunctioning. You can also visually inspect for damage or use a mechanic's stethoscope to listen for the clicking sound each sensor makes when active.
</div>

## Tools & Parts Needed

**Parts:**
- Replacement parking sensor (~$30-50)
- Match your sensor type (check part number)

**Tools:**
- Plastic trim removal tools
- Heat gun or hair dryer (for cold weather)
- Clean microfiber cloth
- Isopropyl alcohol (for cleaning)

## Important: Sensor Types

Tesla has used different parking sensor generations:

| Generation | Identifier | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| USS (Original) | Most pre-2022 vehicles | Standard ultrasonic |
| Later versions | 2022+ | Check compatibility |

**Note:** Tesla removed parking sensors from some 2022+ vehicles entirely, relying on cameras only (Tesla Vision). If your car has no sensors, this guide doesn't apply.

## DIY Replacement Steps

### Method 1: Without Removing Bumper (Easier)

For most sensors, you can replace them without removing the entire bumper:

**Step 1: Access the Sensor**

1. For **front sensors**: Remove the front underhood apron (plastic panel under the frunk)
2. For **rear sensors**: Access through the trunk liner or wheel well liner

**Step 2: Disconnect the Old Sensor**

1. Locate the sensor's electrical connector
2. Press the release tab and disconnect
3. Note how the wiring is routed

**Step 3: Remove the Sensor**

1. From behind the bumper, push the sensor outward
2. The sensor pops out of its mounting hole
3. If stuck, gently warm the bumper with a heat gun (not too hot!)

**Step 4: Install New Sensor**

1. Clean the mounting hole with isopropyl alcohol
2. Push the new sensor in from the outside until it clicks
3. Ensure it sits flush with the bumper
4. Connect the electrical connector

**Step 5: Test**

1. Reassemble any panels you removed
2. Put the car in reverse to activate parking sensors
3. Walk behind the car to trigger the sensors
4. Verify no warning messages appear

### Method 2: Full Bumper Removal (For Difficult Sensors)

Sometimes corner sensors or damaged mounting areas require bumper removal:

**Front Bumper:**
1. Remove wheel well liners (push clips)
2. Remove undertray
3. Disconnect fog lights (if equipped)
4. Remove bumper bolts/clips
5. Carefully pull bumper forward
6. Replace sensor with full access
7. Reverse to reinstall

**Rear Bumper:**
1. Remove rear wheel well liners
2. Remove trunk trim pieces for access
3. Remove bumper bolts/clips
4. Pull bumper away from body
5. Replace sensor
6. Reverse to reinstall

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Be Careful:</strong> Bumpers have electrical connections (lights, sensors). Don't yank the bumper off — disconnect wiring harnesses first.
</div>

## Calibration After Replacement

Most parking sensor replacements do **not** require calibration if:
- You're replacing with the same type of sensor
- The sensor is properly seated
- You didn't move other sensors

If you get persistent warnings after replacement, try:

1. **Soft reboot**: Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. **Service Mode**: Check Driver Assist > Sensors for any calibration options
3. **Drive cycle**: Sometimes sensors calibrate after normal driving

If issues persist, Tesla service can run Toolbox routines to reprogram sensor addresses.

## Where to Buy Sensors

| Source | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Parts | $50-80 | Genuine OEM |
| Amazon/eBay | $20-40 | Aftermarket, check reviews |
| Salvage | $15-30 | Used, verify working |

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>OEM vs Aftermarket:</strong> Genuine Tesla sensors are more reliable but cost more. Quality aftermarket sensors work fine for most owners. Avoid the cheapest no-brand options — they often fail quickly.
</div>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong sensor type** — Verify part number before ordering
2. **Forcing the sensor** — If it won't pop in/out, warm the bumper first
3. **Damaging paint** — Use plastic tools only, never metal
4. **Ignoring routing** — Route wires the same way as original
5. **Overtightening** — Sensors should click in, not be forced

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Time |
|--------|------|------|
| Tesla Service | $300-400+ | 1-2 hours |
| Third-party shop | $150-200 | 1 hour |
| DIY | $30-50 | 30 min |

**Your savings: $250-350** for a straightforward repair.

## When NOT to DIY

Consider professional help if:
- Multiple sensors failed simultaneously (may indicate wiring issue)
- Bumper has significant damage requiring repair
- You're uncomfortable working with trim clips
- The car is under warranty (let Tesla handle it)

## Prevention Tips

- **Park carefully** — Most sensor damage is from impacts
- **Watch for curbs** — Especially with lowered vehicles
- **Pressure wash carefully** — High pressure can damage sensors
- **Address damage quickly** — Cracked sensors let in moisture
