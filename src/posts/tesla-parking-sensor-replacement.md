Tesla parking sensors — officially called **USS (Ultrasonic Sensors)** — can fail from impacts, water intrusion, freezing temperatures, or age. When one goes bad, Tesla service quotes **$300 or more** for a replacement. The sensor itself costs **$20–50**, and the job takes about 30–60 minutes depending on whether you need to pull the bumper.

**Does your Tesla even have parking sensors?** Tesla removed USS from production vehicles starting in **late 2022**:
- **Model 3:** 2017–2022 (produced before ~October 2022) have USS
- **Model Y:** 2020–2022 (produced before ~October 2022) have USS
- **Model S/X:** Refreshed 2021+ models retained USS longer; check your bumper for the small circular sensors
- **2023+ Model 3/Y:** No USS — these use **Tesla Vision** (camera-only). This guide does not apply.

If you're not sure, look at your bumpers. USS sensors are small circular discs (about 18mm diameter) sitting flush with the bumper surface — typically 4 in the front bumper and 4 in the rear.

## Symptoms of a Failed Parking Sensor

- **"Parking assist features may be degraded"** or **"Parking sensors unavailable"** warning on the touchscreen
- **Constant beeping** when parking (phantom obstacle detection)
- **No proximity alerts** when approaching objects
- **Visible damage** — sensor cracked, chipped, or pushed into the bumper
- One sensor showing as offline in diagnostics

You can identify which sensor failed by checking **Controls > Service** on the touchscreen. Some owners also use a simple trick: put the car in reverse and hold your finger over each rear sensor — a working sensor vibrates with a faint clicking/ticking. No vibration = dead sensor.

## Sensor Locations & Part Numbers

### Model 3 / Model Y Layout

Each bumper has **4 USS sensors**: 2 inner (closer to center) and 2 outer (near the corners). That's **8 sensors total** (some Model S/X have 12).

Tesla used two main USS part number families:

| Part Number Base | Type | Position | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1127502-xx-x** | Radial (standard) | Front & rear outer | Most common replacement |
| **1127503-xx-x** | Radial DCR | Front & rear inner/side | Check your specific sensor |

The suffix indicates **color**. You need to match your car's paint:

| Color | Example Suffix |
|---|---|
| Pearl White Multi-Coat | -12-C |
| Solid Black | -01-D |
| Midnight Silver Metallic | -11-D |
| Deep Blue Metallic | -13-D |
| Red Multi-Coat | -08-C |

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Finding Your Exact Part Number:</strong> The best way to confirm is to check <a href="https://epc.tesla.com" target="_blank">epc.tesla.com</a> (Tesla's parts catalog). Navigate to your model → 17 - Electrical → 1727 - Parking Sensors. You'll see the exact part numbers for your VIN. You can also check the old sensor once removed — the part number is printed on it.
</div>

**Where to buy:**
- **Tesla Parts (OEM):** $50–80 each — order through Tesla service or epc.tesla.com
- **EV Parts Online, stock-tesla.com:** $20–40 — aftermarket, color-matched, good quality
- **Amazon/eBay:** $15–35 — aftermarket; check reviews and verify part number compatibility
- **Salvage yards:** $10–25 — used OEM sensors, verify they work before buying

## Tools & Parts Needed

**Parts:**
- Replacement USS sensor ($20–50) — **match your part number and paint color**
- Zip ties (to resecure wiring if needed)

**Tools:**
- Plastic trim removal tools (essential — never use metal pry tools on painted bumpers)
- Heat gun or hair dryer (helps in cold weather when plastic clips are brittle)
- Isopropyl alcohol and clean microfiber cloth
- Flashlight or headlamp
- 10mm socket (if removing undertray)

## DIY Replacement: Method 1 — Without Removing Bumper

For most sensor positions, you can access the sensor from behind without pulling the entire bumper. This is faster and lower-risk.

### Front Sensors

**Step 1: Access from the frunk area**

1. Open the frunk
2. Remove the **front underhood apron** — the plastic panel/cover at the front of the frunk area. It's held by push clips; use a trim tool to pop them
3. For the **inner front sensors** (closest to the license plate area), you can also access through a triangular opening visible once the frunk liner is loosened — several TMC forum members have confirmed this works on Model 3

**Step 2: Disconnect the sensor**

1. Reach behind the bumper and locate the sensor's wiring connector
2. Press the release tab on the connector and disconnect
3. Note the wire routing — take a photo before disconnecting

**Step 3: Remove the old sensor**

1. From behind, push the sensor outward through the bumper
2. The sensor is held in by a friction fit / retaining clip — it should pop out with moderate pressure
3. If the sensor is stuck (common in cold weather or older installations), gently warm the bumper surface with a hair dryer for 30 seconds, then push again

**Step 4: Install the new sensor**

1. Clean the mounting hole with isopropyl alcohol
2. From the front (outside), push the new sensor into the hole until it clicks and sits flush
3. Ensure the sensor face is level with the bumper surface
4. Reconnect the electrical connector — you should feel/hear it click

**Step 5: Test**

1. Reassemble any panels and push clips
2. Shift into reverse (for rear sensors) or drive slowly toward an object (for front sensors)
3. Verify the parking visualization appears on screen and alerts work
4. Check that no warning messages appear

### Rear Sensors

**Step 1: Access from the wheel well or trunk**

1. Turn the steering wheel fully to one side for better wheel well access
2. Peel back the **rear wheel well liner** on the side of the failed sensor — the liner is held by push clips and possibly a few screws
3. Alternatively, access through the **trunk liner** — remove trunk side panels to reach behind the rear bumper
4. For easier access on some positions, you can partially pop out the corner of the rear bumper (just the corner, not the whole bumper) by releasing a few clips in the wheel well

**Steps 2–5:** Same as front sensor procedure above — disconnect, push out, install new, reconnect, test.

## DIY Replacement: Method 2 — Full Bumper Removal

If you can't reach the sensor, or if the retaining clip is broken and you need to work on the mounting area, full bumper removal gives complete access. This adds 20–30 minutes but isn't difficult.

### Front Bumper Removal (Model 3/Y)

1. Remove the **front wheel well liners** (both sides) — push clips and T20 Torx screws
2. Remove the **front undertray/belly pan** — 10mm bolts and push clips
3. Disconnect any **electrical connectors** accessible from below (fog lights if equipped)
4. Remove **bumper mounting bolts/clips** along the top edge (behind the frunk) and sides
5. With a helper, carefully pull the bumper straight forward off the guide pins
6. Replace the sensor(s) with full access
7. Reinstall in reverse order — align carefully before pushing onto guide pins

### Rear Bumper Removal (Model 3/Y)

1. Remove **rear wheel well liners** (both sides)
2. Remove **trunk/tailgate trim panels** that overlap the bumper
3. Disconnect **tail light connectors** if needed for clearance
4. Remove **bumper mounting fasteners** (clips along wheel wells and bolts underneath)
5. Pull bumper straight back
6. Replace sensor(s)
7. Reinstall

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Be Careful:</strong> Bumpers have multiple electrical connections (lights, sensors, possibly cameras). Don't yank — disconnect all harnesses before pulling the bumper away. Label connectors if you're removing multiple.
</div>

## After Replacement: Calibration

The good news: most parking sensor replacements **do not require any calibration**. The sensors are plug-and-play if:
- You're using the same sensor type/generation
- The sensor is properly seated and flush
- You didn't disturb other sensors

If you get persistent warnings after replacement:

1. **Soft reboot** — hold both scroll wheels on the steering wheel for 10 seconds until the screen goes black and restarts
2. **Drive cycle** — drive normally for 10–15 minutes; some sensors self-calibrate
3. **Check seating** — a sensor that's not fully pushed in or sitting at an angle will misread
4. **Tesla Toolbox** — if problems persist, Tesla service can run Toolbox 3.0 diagnostic routines to verify sensor addresses and reprogram if needed. This is sometimes necessary when replacing sensors with a different part revision.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Sensor pushed into bumper (fell inside):**
This is extremely common and often doesn't need a new sensor at all. The retaining clip broke or loosened, and the sensor slipped inward. Access from behind, push it back out, and if the clip is broken, apply a small amount of automotive adhesive or use a new retaining bracket.

**Sensor works intermittently in cold/wet weather:**
Water intrusion through a cracked sensor face. Replace the sensor — once the waterproof seal is compromised, it will only get worse.

**New sensor installed but still showing error:**
- Verify the connector is fully seated
- Check that you bought the correct part number for your vehicle
- Try a soft reboot
- In rare cases, the wiring harness (not the sensor) is the problem — inspect for corrosion or damaged pins

**Multiple sensors failing at once:**
If 2+ sensors on the same bumper fail simultaneously, the issue is more likely a **wiring harness** or **fuse** problem rather than individual sensors. Check the harness connections and fuses before replacing sensors.

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Time |
|--------|------|------|
| Tesla Service Center | $300–400+ | 1–2 hours (plus appointment wait) |
| Third-party body shop | $150–250 | 1 hour |
| DIY (without bumper removal) | $20–50 | 30 min |
| DIY (with bumper removal) | $20–50 | 60 min |

**Your savings: $250–350** for a straightforward sensor swap.

## When NOT to DIY

- **Significant bumper damage** around the sensor area — the mounting point may need repair
- **Multiple simultaneous failures** — likely a wiring harness issue that needs proper diagnosis
- **Vehicle under warranty** — let Tesla handle it at no cost
- **You're uncomfortable with trim clips** — they're easy to break if you've never worked with them (though replacement clips are cheap on Amazon)

## Prevention Tips

- **Avoid pressure washing directly at sensors** — the high-pressure jet can force water past seals or push sensors inward
- **Park carefully** — most sensor damage is from low-speed impacts with curbs, posts, and garage walls
- **Address cracked sensors quickly** — moisture intrusion will kill the electronics
- **In freezing weather**, ice can form around sensors and push them in when it expands — brush off snow/ice gently
