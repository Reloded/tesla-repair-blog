Tesla windshield replacement is more involved than a traditional car because of the Autopilot camera system mounted behind the rearview mirror. After any windshield replacement, camera recalibration is mandatory for Autopilot, auto-wipers, and forward collision warning to function correctly.

## When You Need a Windshield Replacement

- **Large crack** that spans more than 15 cm or is in the driver's line of sight
- **Chip that has spread** despite repair attempts
- **Multiple chips** compromising structural integrity
- **Failed inspection** due to windshield damage
- **Camera obstruction** — crack or damage near the Autopilot camera housing

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Insurance Note:</strong> In many European countries, windshield replacement is covered by comprehensive insurance with little or no deductible. Check your policy before paying out of pocket.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 3–5 hours (plus 1–2 hours cure time before driving)
**Skill Level:** Advanced (this is a two-person job)

**Glass Options:**

- **Tesla OEM windshield** (~$400–800 depending on model) — comes with the correct camera bracket
- **Aftermarket windshield (Pilkington, Saint-Gobain, Fuyao)** (~$200–400) — must match Tesla specs exactly
- **Heated windshield option** (Model 3/Y 2021+) — confirm your car has heated windshield before ordering

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Critical:</strong> The replacement windshield must have the correct camera bracket/mount area. An incorrectly positioned camera bracket will make calibration impossible or unreliable. Always buy Tesla-specific glass.
</div>

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $400–800 | $300–500 | $700–1,300 |
| Safelite / Auto Glass Shop | $300–600 | $150–300 | $450–900 |
| DIY (with helper) | $200–500 | Your time | $200–500 |

**Your savings: $250–800**

## Step-by-Step Windshield Replacement

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Park in a covered area (rain during installation ruins the adhesive)
2. Cover the dashboard, seats, and A-pillars with protective material
3. Disconnect the 12V battery
4. Remove the rearview mirror cover and disconnect the mirror (if applicable)
5. Remove the wiper arms (13mm nut, note their position)
6. Remove the cowl panel at the base of the windshield

### Step 2: Remove the Autopilot Camera Assembly

This is the most Tesla-specific part of the job:

1. Carefully remove the headliner trim around the rearview mirror area
2. Disconnect the camera electrical connectors
3. Note exactly how the camera bracket sits against the windshield
4. Remove the camera bracket — it may be adhered to the old windshield
5. **Do NOT drop or bump the cameras** — they are precision-aligned components

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take photos of the camera assembly from multiple angles before removal. This helps ensure correct reinstallation.
</div>

### Step 3: Cut Out the Old Windshield

1. Use a cold knife or oscillating tool to cut through the urethane adhesive around the perimeter
2. Start from the bottom corners and work your way around
3. Use windshield removal wire for areas the knife can't reach
4. With a helper, use suction cups to lift the old windshield out
5. **Be careful around the camera area** — don't damage the mounting surface

### Step 4: Prepare the Frame

1. Trim the old urethane to a uniform height of 1–2mm (do NOT scrape down to bare metal)
2. Clean the bonding surface with glass cleaner and then primer activator
3. Apply glass primer to any bare metal spots
4. Apply body primer to the mating surface and let it tack (per adhesive manufacturer's instructions)

### Step 5: Prepare the New Windshield

1. Clean the bonding edge of the new windshield
2. Apply glass primer to the bonding surface (the black frit area)
3. Allow primer to dry per manufacturer's directions (typically 5–10 minutes)
4. Dry-fit the windshield to verify alignment before applying adhesive

### Step 6: Apply Adhesive and Install

1. Apply a continuous bead of urethane adhesive around the windshield frame
2. Bead should be approximately 8–10mm in diameter, triangular pattern
3. With your helper, carefully place the new windshield using suction cups
4. Center the glass and press firmly around the perimeter
5. The windshield should sit flush with the body panels

### Step 7: Reinstall Camera Assembly

1. Mount the camera bracket to the new windshield exactly as it was positioned on the old one
2. Reconnect all camera electrical connectors
3. Reinstall the headliner trim
4. Reinstall the rearview mirror

### Step 8: Finishing Up

1. Reinstall the cowl panel and wiper arms
2. Clean up any excess adhesive
3. Reconnect the 12V battery
4. **Do NOT drive for at least 1–2 hours** to allow the urethane to cure
5. Avoid car washes and slamming doors for 24–48 hours

## Camera Recalibration (Critical!)

After windshield replacement, you **must** recalibrate the Autopilot cameras:

1. Go to **Controls > Service > Camera Calibration > Clear Calibration**
2. The touchscreen will confirm calibration has been cleared
3. Autopilot, auto-wipers, and other camera-dependent features will be unavailable until recalibration completes
4. Drive on well-marked roads (clear lane lines) for **20–100 miles (32–160 km)**
5. The calibration progress shows on the touchscreen
6. Once complete, all features will resume normal operation

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Do not use Autopilot until calibration is complete. If calibration doesn't complete after 100 miles, contact Tesla — the camera bracket may be misaligned.
</div>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Wrong windshield** — Must be Tesla-specific with correct camera mount area
- **Skipping primer** — Adhesion failure can cause the windshield to leak or detach
- **Damaging cameras** — Handle with extreme care, avoid touching lenses
- **Driving too soon** — Urethane needs cure time or the windshield can shift
- **Forgetting calibration** — Autopilot won't work without recalibration
- **Working alone** — Windshields are heavy and awkward; you need a helper
