The cabin air filter is one of the easiest DIY maintenance items on any Tesla. Tesla recommends replacing it every 2-3 years, but if you live in a dusty area or have allergies, yearly replacement makes sense. This is a 10-minute job that Tesla charges $75-150 for—you can do it for $20-50.

## Why Replace Your Cabin Air Filter?

The cabin air filter cleans all the air that enters your Tesla's interior through the HVAC system. A dirty filter causes:

- **Reduced AC/heating efficiency** (if [AC isn't cooling](/posts/tesla-ac-not-cooling/) properly, start here)
- **Musty or bad smells** when the AC runs
- **Foggy windows** that don't clear quickly
- **Increased allergens** inside the car
- **Louder fan noise** as the system works harder

## Filter Options

**Standard Replacement (~$20-40):**
- Direct OEM-equivalent filters
- Adequate for most conditions
- Brands: FRAM, EPAuto, Spearhead

**HEPA Upgrade (~$40-80):**
- Hospital-grade air filtration
- Removes 99.97% of particles
- Great for allergies, wildfire smoke, pollution
- Brands: Taptes, Turoaz, premium options

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> If you live in a city or have allergies, the HEPA upgrade is worth the extra $20-30. It makes a noticeable difference in air quality.

## Model 3 and Model Y: Step-by-Step

Per [Tesla's official procedure](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Public/diy/model3/en_us/GUID-DB0A1E3C-926E-498C-A2FD-A27B8421A471.html), the cabin air filter is accessed from the **front passenger footwell** (not behind the glovebox).

### Tools Needed
- T20 Torx screwdriver (or T20/6mm combo tool)
- Plastic trim removal tool
- Small flashlight (helpful)

### Step 1: Prepare the Work Area

1. Turn off the climate control system
2. Open the front passenger door
3. Move the front passenger seat **fully rearward**
4. Remove the floor mat

### Step 2: Remove the Footwell Cover

1. Using a trim tool, release the push clips on the footwell cover
2. Lower the cover carefully
3. Disconnect the two electrical connectors (footwell light and speaker)
4. Set the cover aside

### Step 3: Access the Filter Housing

1. Use a trim tool to release the right side panel from the center console
2. Locate the cabin filter cover on the HVAC module
3. Remove the **T20 screw** (some vehicles have a T20/6mm hybrid fastener) securing the filter cover
4. Release the filter cover and move it aside

### Step 4: Remove the Old Filters

1. The Model 3/Y has **two filters** stacked (upper and lower)
2. Fold the upper filter's pull tabs outward
3. Pull the **upper filter** out first
4. Then pull the **lower filter** upward and out

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> The filters may be dirty—have a bag ready. If you see debris in the housing, vacuum it out before installing new filters. Avoid touching nearby electrical connectors.
</div>

### Step 5: Install the New Filters

1. Check the **airflow direction arrows** on the new filters
2. Insert filters with arrows pointing **toward the rear of the vehicle**
3. Install the **lower filter first**, then the upper filter
4. Fold the filter tabs inward
5. Reinstall the filter cover and T20 screw
6. Reinstall the side panel and footwell cover (reconnect electrical connectors)

### Step 6: Reset the Filter Maintenance Reminder

On vehicles with software 2024.14+, reset the cabin filter health score:
- Go to **Service Mode > Thermal > Air Filter Diagnostics > Reset Filter Health**

**Test the AC** to make sure everything is working properly.

## Model S: Step-by-Step

The Model S filter location varies by year:

**2012-2016 Model S:**
- Located under the hood (frunk area)
- Access through the HVAC intake near the windshield

**2017+ Model S:**
- Located behind the center console or under the dashboard
- More involved replacement—remove trim panels

### General Process for Model S:

1. Locate the HVAC intake (usually under a plastic cover in the frunk)
2. Remove the cover screws/clips
3. Pull out the old filter
4. Install the new filter with correct airflow direction
5. Reinstall the cover

## Model X: Step-by-Step

Model X filter locations:

**Front Cabin Filter:**
- Behind the glovebox (similar to Model 3/Y)
- Follow similar steps

**Rear Filter (Bioweapon Defense Mode models):**
- Located in the rear of the vehicle
- Accessed through the trunk area
- Large HEPA filter—expensive but lasts longer

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Bioweapon Defense Mode:</strong> If your Model S or X has this feature, you have a large HEPA filter that's more complex to replace. Consider having this done professionally or budget extra time and research.
</div>

## How Often to Replace

| Condition | Replacement Interval |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Normal driving | Every 2-3 years |
| Dusty/rural areas | Every 1-2 years |
| High pollen/allergies | Every year |
| Wildfire smoke exposure | Replace immediately after |
| Bioweapon Defense HEPA | Every 3-5 years |

## Cost Comparison

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Tesla Service Center | $75-150+ |
| DIY Standard Filter | $20-40 |
| DIY HEPA Upgrade | $40-80 |

**Your savings: $35-110**

## Signs Your Filter Needs Replacement

- **Reduced airflow** from the vents
- **Musty smell** when AC starts
- **AC seems weaker** than before
- **Allergies acting up** in the car
- **Visible dust** on the filter (if you check it)

## Pro Tips

1. **Buy in bulk** - Filters are cheap. Buy 2-3 at a time and replace more frequently.

2. **Use genuine HEPA** - Not all "HEPA-style" filters are true HEPA. Look for filters that meet the 99.97% standard.

3. **Check when buying used** - If you buy a used Tesla, the cabin filter is probably overdue. Replace it immediately.

4. **Combine with AC cleaning** - While the filter is out, consider using an AC evaporator cleaner spray for better results. If you're experiencing [heat pump problems](/posts/tesla-heat-pump-problems/), a clean filter is the first step.
