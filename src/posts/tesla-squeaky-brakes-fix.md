Squeaky brakes on a Tesla are more common than on gas cars—and the reason is actually a good thing. Because regenerative braking does most of the work, your traditional brakes get used less. This can cause rust and glazing that leads to noise.

## Why Tesla Brakes Squeak

### The Regenerative Braking Effect

When you lift off the accelerator in a Tesla, the electric motors slow the car down and convert that kinetic energy back into battery charge. This means:

- Traditional brakes are used **80-90% less** than on gas cars
- Brake rotors develop **surface rust** from sitting unused
- Brake pads can **glaze over** from infrequent use
- Dust and debris accumulate without being worn off

<div class="info-box">
<strong>This Is Actually Good:</strong> Squeaky brakes in a Tesla often indicate that your brakes are barely being used—which means they'll last much longer. The noise is usually cosmetic, not a safety issue.
</div>

### Common Causes of Tesla Brake Noise

1. **Surface Rust** - Forms overnight or after car sits, especially in humid climates
2. **Glazed Pads** - Smooth, hardened surface from light use
3. **Dust/Debris** - Accumulates between pad and rotor
4. **Cold Weather** - Brakes squeak more when cold
5. **Cheap Brake Pads** - Low-quality aftermarket pads can be noisy
6. **Actually Worn Pads** - If pads are thin, wear indicators may be contacting the rotor

## Diagnosing the Noise

### Normal Noises (Don't Worry)

- **Morning squeaking** that goes away after a few stops
- **Light squeal** after the car sits for a day or more
- **Noise in rain/humidity** that disappears once brakes dry
- **Cold weather squeaking** that fades as brakes warm up

### Concerning Noises (Investigate)

- **Grinding** - Metal on metal, indicates worn pads
- **Constant squealing** - Doesn't go away with use
- **Pulsating pedal** - Warped rotors
- **Clicking or clunking** - Loose components

## DIY Fixes for Squeaky Tesla Brakes

### Fix #1: The "Burnish" Procedure

For surface rust and light glazing, the simplest fix is to use your brakes more aggressively:

1. Find a safe, empty road or parking lot
2. Accelerate to 40-50 mph
3. Brake firmly (but not emergency-stop hard) to about 10 mph
4. Repeat 8-10 times with a few minutes of cooling between cycles
5. Allow brakes to cool completely before parking

This removes surface rust and re-seats the pads on the rotors.

### Fix #2: Manual Cleaning

If the burnish procedure doesn't work:

**What you'll need:**
- Jack and jack stands
- Wheel removal tools
- Brake cleaner spray
- Wire brush
- Clean rags

**Steps:**

1. Lift the car and remove the wheel
2. Spray brake cleaner on the rotor and caliper area
3. Use a wire brush to remove visible rust from the rotor surface
4. Clean out any debris from around the caliper
5. Spray again and wipe clean
6. Reinstall wheel
7. Repeat for other wheels if needed

### Fix #3: Lightly Scuff the Pads

For glazed pads that don't respond to the burnish procedure:

1. Remove the caliper (see [brake pad replacement guide](/posts/tesla-brake-pad-replacement/))
2. Remove the brake pads
3. Use 150-grit sandpaper to lightly scuff the pad surface
4. Don't remove much material—just break up the glaze
5. Clean with brake cleaner
6. Apply caliper grease to the pad backing and slide points
7. Reinstall pads and caliper

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Only do this if you're comfortable removing the caliper. If not, this is a simple job for any brake shop.
</div>

### Fix #4: Lubricate Caliper Slide Pins

Sometimes squeaking comes from dry caliper slide pins:

1. Remove the caliper
2. Pull out the slide pins (bolts that the caliper moves on)
3. Clean old grease off the pins
4. Apply fresh brake caliper grease
5. Reinstall and test

## Preventive Measures

### Use Your Brakes Regularly

The best prevention is regular brake use:

- **Once a week:** Do a few firm braking maneuvers to keep rotors clean
- **Before parking long-term:** Do several hard stops to clean surfaces
- **Don't rely 100% on regen:** Use the brake pedal occasionally

### Adjust Regenerative Braking Settings

If you're rarely using the brake pedal:

1. Consider using "Standard" or "Low" regen braking occasionally
2. This forces more brake pedal use and keeps pads/rotors active
3. Not necessary all the time—just occasionally to maintain brakes

### Coating Options

Some owners apply protective coating to rotors:

- **Zinc plating** - Resists rust, professional application
- **Ceramic coating** - Can help with dust and surface rust
- **Not recommended:** DIY sprays claiming to eliminate squeak—they usually don't last

## When to Seek Professional Help

Visit a mechanic or Tesla service if:

- Grinding noise (metal on metal)
- Brake warning lights on dashboard
- Pulsating or spongy brake pedal
- Noise persists after DIY fixes
- You're uncomfortable doing the work yourself

## Cost Summary

| Fix | Cost |
|-----|------|
| Burnish procedure | Free |
| Brake cleaner + cleaning | $10-20 |
| Scuff pads + caliper grease | $20-30 |
| Professional brake service | $100-300 |

## The Bottom Line

Squeaky brakes on a Tesla are usually not a safety concern. They're a side effect of the regenerative braking system that makes your brakes last 100,000+ miles. Try the burnish procedure first—it solves the problem for most owners.

*Don't let brake noise stress you out. In most cases, it's just your Tesla's way of telling you that regenerative braking is doing its job.*
