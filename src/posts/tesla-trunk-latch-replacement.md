A Tesla trunk that won't latch, randomly opens, or shows a "Trunk Open" warning when it's clearly closed is almost always caused by a failed micro switch inside the latch assembly. This is a common issue on Model 3 and Model Y, especially in cold or wet climates where moisture corrodes the switch contacts.

## Symptoms

- **"Trunk Open" warning** on the touchscreen when the trunk is closed
- **Trunk won't stay latched** — pops open while driving
- **Trunk opens by itself** randomly
- **Interior lights stay on** (car thinks trunk is open)
- **Phantom battery drain** from the car never entering sleep mode (see our [phantom drain guide](/posts/tesla-phantom-battery-drain-fix/))
- **Sentry mode constantly triggers** due to "trunk open" state

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### Clean the Latch

Before replacing anything:

1. Open the trunk and locate the latch mechanism on the trunk lid
2. Spray electrical contact cleaner into the latch mechanism
3. Open and close the trunk several times to work it in
4. Also spray the striker (the U-shaped hook on the body)

### Adjust the Striker

The trunk striker may have shifted:

1. Loosen the striker bolt (usually 10mm) slightly
2. Adjust the striker position — typically pushing it slightly inward helps
3. Retighten and test

If cleaning and adjustment don't fix it, the latch assembly needs replacement.

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 30–60 minutes
**Skill Level:** Beginner

**Parts:**

- **Trunk latch assembly** (~$40–80 from Tesla parts suppliers or aftermarket)
- The assembly includes the micro switch — you don't need to replace them separately

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $80–150 | $150–250 | $230–400 |
| Independent Shop | $60–100 | $80–150 | $140–250 |
| DIY | $40–80 | Your time | $40–80 |

**Your savings: $100–320**

## Step-by-Step Latch Replacement

### Step 1: Access the Latch

**Model 3/Y:**

1. Open the trunk
2. Remove the trunk interior trim panel — it's held by clips and possibly T30 Torx screws
3. Peel back any sound deadening material to reveal the latch assembly
4. The latch is mounted to the trunk lid with 2–3 bolts (10mm)

**Model S:**

1. Open the trunk
2. Remove the interior trunk trim to access the latch
3. The latch is similarly bolted to the trunk lid

### Step 2: Disconnect and Remove

1. Disconnect the electrical connector from the latch (press the release tab)
2. Mark the position of the latch with tape or a marker — this helps with alignment on reinstall
3. Remove the mounting bolts (10mm)
4. Remove the latch assembly

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take a photo of the latch position before removal. Correct alignment ensures the trunk closes smoothly.

### Step 3: Install the New Latch

1. Position the new latch in the same location as the old one (use your marks/photos)
2. Install the mounting bolts hand-tight first
3. Connect the electrical connector
4. Close the trunk gently to test alignment — adjust the latch position if needed
5. Once aligned, torque the mounting bolts to **9 Nm (7 ft-lbs)**

### Step 4: Test

1. Close the trunk — it should latch firmly with a solid click
2. Check the touchscreen — no "Trunk Open" warning should appear
3. Open and close several times to confirm consistent operation
4. Test the power trunk close function (if equipped)
5. Verify Sentry mode doesn't false-trigger

### Step 5: Reassemble

1. Reinstall the sound deadening material
2. Reinstall the trunk interior trim panel
3. Press all clips firmly into place

## Model Y Power Liftgate Note

The Model Y's power liftgate has an additional component — the liftgate actuator — that can also cause latching issues. If the liftgate doesn't close fully (stops short and reopens), the issue may be:

- **Liftgate struts** — worn struts resist the close mechanism. See our [trunk strut replacement guide](/posts/tesla-trunk-strut-replacement/)
- **Height setting** — the liftgate close height may need adjustment via Controls > Vehicle > Trunk

## Preventing Future Issues

- **Apply silicone lubricant** to the latch mechanism annually
- **Keep the trunk seal clean** — dirt and debris prevent full closure
- **In cold climates**, use silicone spray on the seal to prevent freezing
- **Don't slam the trunk** — let the power close function do its job
