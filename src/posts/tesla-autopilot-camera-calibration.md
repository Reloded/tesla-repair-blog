Tesla's Autopilot relies on cameras positioned around the vehicle to see the road, detect obstacles, and navigate. When these cameras need recalibration—whether after a software update, windshield replacement, or malfunction—you'll see warnings and degraded Autopilot performance. Here's how to trigger recalibration and resolve common camera issues.

## When Calibration is Needed

**Automatic Calibration Triggers:**
- New vehicle delivery
- Software updates (sometimes)
- Service center work

**Manual Calibration May Be Needed After:**
- Windshield replacement
- Camera replacement
- Major front-end collision repair
- Persistent "camera blocked" warnings

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Calibration Progress:</strong> During calibration, you'll see a progress indicator on screen. Full calibration typically takes 20-100 miles of varied driving.
</div>

## Camera Locations on Tesla

**Model 3/Y (8 cameras):**
- 3 forward-facing (behind windshield)
- 2 side forward (in fenders)
- 2 side rearward (in fenders)
- 1 rear (above license plate)

**Model S/X (similar arrangement):**
- Same general configuration
- Additional ultrasonic sensors around vehicle

## How to Force Camera Recalibration

### Method 1: Service Menu

1. Go to **Controls** > **Service**
2. Select **Camera Calibration**
3. Choose **Clear Calibration**
4. The car will restart calibration process

### Method 2: After Windshield Replacement

Windshield shops should recalibrate, but if they don't:

1. Contact Tesla Service
2. Request remote calibration initiation
3. Or visit service center for proper alignment check

### Method 3: Soft Reset

For minor camera glitches:

1. Put car in Park
2. Hold both scroll wheels for 10+ seconds
3. Wait for screen to reboot
4. Drive and allow cameras to reinitialize

## Calibration Best Practices

**Ideal Driving Conditions:**
- Clear weather (no rain, snow, or fog)
- Daylight hours
- Well-marked roads with clear lane lines
- Highway driving (40-70 mph)
- Varied speeds and light curves

**Poor Calibration Conditions:**
- Night driving
- Heavy traffic (stopping and starting)
- Construction zones
- Faded lane markings
- Extreme weather

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Patience Required:</strong> Calibration can take anywhere from 20 to 100+ miles. Don't rely on Autopilot during this period—the system is learning and may behave erratically.
</div>

## Cleaning Cameras

Dirty cameras are the #1 cause of "Camera Blocked" warnings.

### Exterior Cameras (B-pillar and Fenders)

1. Use ammonia-free glass cleaner
2. Spray onto microfiber cloth (not directly on camera)
3. Gently wipe camera lens
4. Use dry cloth to remove streaks
5. Check for water spots or residue

### Forward-Facing Cameras (Behind Windshield)

1. Clean inside of windshield in camera area
2. Use isopropyl alcohol for stubborn spots
3. Ensure no tint or coating covers camera area
4. Check for condensation between glass layers

### Rear Camera

1. Access above license plate
2. Same cleaning procedure as exterior cameras
3. Check for scratches on lens cover

## Troubleshooting Camera Errors

### "Camera Blocked or Blinded"

**Causes:**
- Dirty lens
- Sunlight directly into camera
- Rain, snow, or condensation
- Damaged lens cover

**Solutions:**
1. Clean all cameras
2. Wait for sun position to change
3. Check for physical damage
4. If persistent, may need camera replacement

### "Autopilot Unavailable"

**Causes:**
- Calibration incomplete
- Camera malfunction
- Software glitch

**Solutions:**
1. Check calibration progress in Controls
2. Perform soft reset (scroll wheel hold)
3. Ensure recent software update installed
4. Schedule service if persistent

### Partial Autopilot Features

**Example:** Lane keeping works but not auto lane change

**Causes:**
- One or more cameras not calibrated
- Side cameras blocked or dirty

**Solutions:**
1. Clean all 8 cameras
2. Drive varied routes to complete calibration
3. Clear and restart calibration if stuck

## After Windshield Replacement

Windshield replacement is the most common cause of calibration issues.

**What Should Happen:**
1. Shop removes old windshield
2. New windshield installed with correct glass (Tesla-approved)
3. Calibration target used to align cameras
4. Calibration confirmed before customer pickup

**What Often Goes Wrong:**
- Wrong glass type used (affects camera vision)
- Calibration skipped due to time/equipment
- Aftermarket glass with optical distortion

**Your Checklist:**
- Confirm shop uses OEM or Tesla-approved glass
- Ask about calibration procedure
- Test Autopilot before leaving shop
- Keep receipt showing calibration performed

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Insurance Tip:</strong> When filing a windshield claim, specify that Tesla-compatible glass and Autopilot recalibration are required. This prevents claim disputes later.
</div>

## When to Visit Tesla Service

**Schedule service if:**
- Calibration doesn't complete after 200+ miles
- Same camera error persists after cleaning
- Autopilot behaves dangerously (sudden braking, swerving)
- Physical damage visible on any camera
- Error appears immediately after repair work

**What Service Will Do:**
- Hardware diagnostic on all cameras
- Forced calibration with specialized targets
- Camera replacement if defective
- Software reflash if needed

## Cost Comparison

| Issue | DIY Cost | Service Cost |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Cleaning cameras | Free | $50-100 |
| Software recalibration | Free | $100-200 |
| Windshield + recalibration | N/A | $1,000-2,500 |
| Camera replacement | N/A | $300-800 per camera |

## Prevention Tips

1. **Clean cameras weekly** - Quick wipe during charging
2. **Use quality washer fluid** - Prevents residue buildup
3. **Avoid car washes with harsh chemicals** - Can coat camera lenses
4. **Park strategically** - Avoid direct sun on camera areas when possible
5. **Address chips immediately** - Windshield damage can affect camera area

*Autopilot camera issues are usually simple to fix—most are just dirty lenses or incomplete calibration. Clean your cameras regularly, drive varied routes after any service work, and give the system time to learn. If problems persist beyond 200 miles, then consider service.*
