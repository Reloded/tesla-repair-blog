Discovering moisture or fog inside your Tesla headlights is frustrating—and unfortunately, quite common. This condensation can reduce visibility, look unsightly, and potentially damage the LED components over time. The good news is that most cases can be fixed at home without expensive dealership visits.

## Why Do Tesla Headlights Get Moisture Inside?

Headlights aren't completely sealed units. They have small vents that allow air to circulate and equalize pressure as the lights heat up and cool down. Condensation forms when:

- **Temperature fluctuations** cause humid air to condense on cold surfaces
- **Failed or blocked vents** trap moisture inside
- **Damaged seals** allow water to enter
- **Cracked housings** from road debris
- **Manufacturing defects** (covered under warranty)

<strong>Warranty Check:</strong> If your Tesla is under warranty and shows excessive condensation, contact Tesla Service first. Manufacturing seal defects should be covered at no cost.

## Signs of Headlight Condensation Problems

- Visible water droplets inside the lens
- Foggy or hazy appearance that doesn't clear
- Moisture that returns repeatedly after sunny days
- Water pooling at the bottom of the housing
- Reduced light output or uneven beam pattern

## DIY Solutions for Headlight Condensation

### Method 1: Natural Evaporation (Minor Condensation)

For light condensation that appears occasionally:

1. Park in direct sunlight with headlights on for 30-60 minutes
2. The heat will evaporate moisture through the vents
3. If condensation returns frequently, proceed to other methods

### Method 2: Desiccant Packets (Moderate Condensation)

Adding desiccant absorbs excess moisture:

1. Access the headlight housing by removing the wheel liner
2. Locate the vent holes on the back of the headlight
3. Place silica gel packets near vents (not blocking them)
4. Replace packets every 3-6 months or when saturated

### Method 3: Reseal the Headlight (Severe Condensation)

For persistent moisture, resealing is necessary:

**Step 1: Remove the Headlight**
1. Disconnect the 12V battery (safety precaution)
2. Remove the front bumper or wheel liner for access
3. Disconnect electrical connectors
4. Remove mounting bolts (typically T25 or T30 Torx)

**Step 2: Open and Dry the Housing**
1. Use a heat gun on low to soften the butyl sealant
2. Carefully separate the lens from the housing
3. Clean the interior with a microfiber cloth
4. Allow to dry completely (24+ hours recommended)

**Step 3: Reseal and Reinstall**
1. Apply fresh butyl sealant around the perimeter
2. Press lens firmly into place
3. Use gentle heat to cure the sealant
4. Reinstall headlight and reconnect everything

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a hair dryer or heat gun on low setting while resealing. Too much heat can warp the plastic lens.

## Preventing Future Condensation

- **Check vents regularly** - ensure they're not blocked by debris
- **Park in covered areas** when possible during temperature swings
- **Inspect seals annually** for cracks or deterioration
- **Avoid pressure washing** directly into headlight vents

## When to Seek Professional Help

Consider Tesla Service or a professional if:

- Condensation doesn't clear with DIY methods
- You notice water sloshing inside the housing
- LED elements show signs of corrosion or damage
- The housing is cracked and needs replacement
- Your vehicle is under warranty

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | DIY Cost | Tesla Service |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Desiccant packets | €5-15 | N/A |
| Reseal only | €20-40 | €150-300 |
| Headlight replacement | €800-1500 | €1500-3000+ |

Addressing headlight condensation early prevents LED damage and maintains your Tesla's appearance. Most cases are easily resolved with basic tools and patience.
