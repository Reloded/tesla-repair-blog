The rear camera on your Tesla is essential for safe reversing and provides video for Sentry Mode recordings. When it becomes blurry, foggy, or shows a distorted image, you need to diagnose whether it's a simple cleaning issue or something more serious.

## Identifying the Problem

Before cleaning, identify your specific issue:

- **External dirt** - Road grime, salt, bugs on lens
- **Water droplets** - Rain or car wash residue
- **Internal fog** - Moisture inside the camera housing
- **Scratched lens** - Physical damage
- **Camera failure** - Hardware malfunction

## External Lens Cleaning

Most blurry camera issues are simply dirty lenses.

### Proper Cleaning Technique

1. **Park the car** safely
2. **Locate the camera** - above the license plate
3. **Spray lens cleaner** on a microfiber cloth (never directly on camera)
4. **Gently wipe** the lens in circular motions
5. **Use dry section** of cloth to remove residue
6. **Check camera view** on screen

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Clean your rear camera weekly during winter or dusty conditions. Salt and road grime build up quickly and affect image quality.
</div>

### What to Avoid

- **Don't use paper towels** - Can scratch the lens
- **No household cleaners** - Can damage lens coating
- **Avoid high pressure** - Don't blast with car wash wand
- **Don't scrub hard** - Gentle pressure only

## Water Droplets

### After Rain or Car Wash

Water droplets on the lens cause blurry spots:

1. **Wipe with microfiber cloth** immediately
2. **Apply water-repellent coating** (Rain-X or similar)
3. **Check camera mount angle** - may be collecting water

### Preventing Water Buildup

- Apply hydrophobic coating to the lens
- Check that camera housing seal is intact
- Ensure no debris is trapping water near lens

## Internal Fog (Condensation)

If fog is inside the camera housing, external cleaning won't help.

### Why Cameras Fog Internally

- **Temperature changes** - Cold to warm transitions
- **Seal failure** - Water entering housing
- **Humidity exposure** - High moisture environments

### DIY Fixes for Internal Fog

**Method 1: Heat Cycle**
1. Park in direct sunlight or warm garage
2. Turn on rear defrost (may help warm camera)
3. Leave for several hours
4. Check if fog clears

**Method 2: Desiccant**
1. Place silica gel packets near camera (inside trunk)
2. Close trunk to create dry environment
3. Leave overnight
4. Check for improvement

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> If internal fog returns repeatedly, the camera seal has likely failed. This usually requires camera replacement.
</div>

### Professional Moisture Removal

If DIY methods don't work:

- Tesla service can access and reseal cameras
- Some cameras need full replacement
- Warranty may cover moisture intrusion

## Scratched Lens

### Assessing Scratch Damage

Minor scratches may not affect image quality. Deep scratches will cause:

- Permanent blurry spots
- Glare in certain lighting
- Distorted image areas

### Scratch Repair Options

**Minor Scratches:**
- Camera lens polish may help
- Results vary - test on small area first
- Often not worth the risk

**Significant Scratches:**
- Camera replacement recommended
- Polish can make things worse
- Image quality won't fully recover

## Camera Replacement

### When to Replace

Consider replacement if:

- Internal fog won't clear
- Lens is severely scratched
- Image is distorted or has dead spots
- Camera shows complete failure (black screen)

### DIY vs. Service

**DIY Replacement:**
- Aftermarket cameras available
- Moderate difficulty - requires panel removal
- Cost: $100-200 for camera
- Risk: Improper installation affects Autopilot

**Tesla Service:**
- Uses OEM camera
- Properly calibrated
- Cost: $400-600 installed
- Warranty on work

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> For rear camera replacement, Tesla service is often worth the extra cost due to calibration requirements and Autopilot integration.
</div>

## Camera Calibration After Replacement

If you replace the camera:

1. New [calibration](/posts/tesla-autopilot-camera-calibration/) is required
2. Drive 20-50 miles on well-marked roads
3. System will calibrate automatically
4. Autopilot features may be limited during calibration

## Checking Camera Status

To verify camera operation:

1. Put car in Reverse
2. View should appear on screen
3. Image should be clear and stable
4. Check Sentry Mode recordings for quality

## Preventive Care

Keep your rear camera working well:

- **Weekly cleaning** during dirty weather
- **Apply hydrophobic coating** every few months
- **Inspect seal** around camera for damage
- **Avoid pressure washing** directly at camera

*A clear rear camera is essential for safety and security. Most issues are solved with regular cleaning, but don't ignore persistent fog or image problems.*
