Teslas are built with aluminum body panels and a steel-aluminum hybrid structure, which makes them more corrosion-resistant than fully steel cars—but **not rust-proof**. The subframe, suspension components, brake calipers, and various steel fasteners are all vulnerable, especially if you drive in regions that salt roads in winter. This guide covers everything you need to know about protecting your Tesla from rust and corrosion.

## Do Teslas Rust?

The short answer: **yes, but selectively**. Here's what's at risk and what isn't:

### What Doesn't Rust
- **Body panels** — Model 3/Y use aluminum and steel panels with excellent factory paint and e-coating
- **Aluminum subframe components** — aluminum corrodes differently (white oxidation, not red rust)
- **Battery enclosure** — sealed and protected from factory

### What Does Rust
- **Steel subframe bolts and brackets** — these are the #1 rust problem on Teslas
- **Brake rotors and calipers** — especially with regenerative braking (less mechanical braking = less cleaning of rotor surface)
- **Suspension components** — control arms, sway bar links, tie rod ends
- **Underbody steel reinforcements** — where road salt accumulates
- **Trunk/frunk hinges and latches** — exposed to water splash

> ⚠️ **EU & Nordic owners:** If you live in Scandinavia, the Baltics, Germany, Poland, or anywhere roads are salted in winter, rust prevention isn't optional—it's essential maintenance. We see significant subframe corrosion on 3-4 year old Model 3s in Lithuania.

## When Should You Apply Protection?

| Timing | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **New Tesla** | Within the first 6 months—before the first winter |
| **1-3 years old** | Now. Inspect and apply undercoating |
| **3+ years old** | Inspect first—you may need rust treatment before sealing |
| **Best season** | Late summer/early autumn (dry, warm, before salt season) |

The worst mistake is sealing *over* existing rust. Always inspect and treat rust spots first.

## Types of Rust Protection

### 1. Underbody Undercoating

A thick protective layer sprayed onto the exposed underside of the car. This is your primary defense.

**Product types:**
- **Wax-based (Fluid Film, Permatex)** — self-healing, needs annual reapplication, excellent for DIY
- **Rubber-based (3M, Würth)** — harder shell, lasts 3-5 years, professional application recommended
- **Oil-based (Dinitrol, Tectyl)** — penetrating, great for older cars with some corrosion

**Our recommendation:** Wax-based undercoating for DIY (Fluid Film or equivalent). It's forgiving, doesn't require perfect surface prep, and can be reapplied annually.

### 2. Cavity Wax / Hollow Section Sealing

Many rust problems start *inside* hollow structural members where moisture gets trapped but can't dry. Cavity wax is injected into these spaces through drain holes or drilled access points.

**Popular products in Europe:**
- Mike Sanders Korrosionsschutzfett
- Timemax Hohlraumversiegelung
- Dinitrol ML

This is the most effective long-term protection but harder to DIY properly.

### 3. Ceramic Coating (for underbody)

Some detailers now offer ceramic coating for the underbody. It's more expensive but provides a hard, hydrophobic surface that repels water and salt. Good as a supplement to undercoating, not a replacement.

### 4. Rust Converter + Touch-Up

For existing rust spots. Rust converter (phosphoric acid based) chemically converts iron oxide to iron phosphate—a stable, paintable surface. Apply this *before* any undercoating on affected areas.

## DIY Undercoating: Step-by-Step

### What You Need

- Undercoating spray (Fluid Film or 3M) — 2-3 cans for full underbody
- Cavity wax spray with extension tube — 1-2 cans
- Rust converter spray (if any existing rust)
- Pressure washer
- Car ramps or jack stands ([proper jack points](/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/))
- Plastic sheeting / masking tape
- Safety glasses and gloves
- Drop cloth or cardboard to catch drips

### Step 1: Lift the Car Safely

Use car ramps for easy access or jack stands at Tesla's designated jack points. See our [Tesla Jack Points & Lifting Guide](/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/) for exact locations.

> ⚠️ **Never work under a car supported only by a jack.** Always use jack stands or ramps.

### Step 2: Clean the Underbody

This is the most important step. Undercoating applied over dirt, salt, or loose rust will fail.

1. Pressure wash the entire underbody thoroughly
2. Pay extra attention to wheel wells, subframe areas, and suspension mounts
3. Use a degreaser on any oily spots
4. **Let it dry completely** — at least 24 hours in a warm, dry environment

If you can, do this on a sunny day and let the car sit overnight in a garage.

### Step 3: Inspect for Existing Rust

With the car clean and dry, inspect every steel component:

- **Subframe bolts and mounts** — look for orange/brown discoloration
- **Brake components** — surface rust on rotors is normal; deep pitting on calipers is not
- **Suspension arms and links** — check where rubber bushings meet metal
- **Weld seams** — factory welds can trap moisture

If you find rust, treat it with rust converter spray before proceeding. Let the converter cure per product instructions (usually 24 hours).

### Step 4: Mask Off Sensitive Areas

Protect these from overspray:
- **Brake rotors and pads** — overspray here is dangerous
- **Drive unit / motor** — keep spray away from electrical connections
- **HV battery pack seams** — don't clog drainage paths
- **Exhaust/cooling fans** — avoid blocking airflow
- **Suspension bushings** — some products degrade rubber (check product compatibility)

Use plastic sheeting and painter's tape. Take your time here.

### Step 5: Apply Undercoating

1. Shake the can thoroughly (2+ minutes)
2. Hold 20-30 cm from the surface
3. Apply in thin, even coats — 2-3 passes is better than one thick coat
4. Cover all exposed steel surfaces, focusing on:
   - Subframe and subframe mounts
   - Wheel wells (inside and lip)
   - Suspension mounting points
   - Any visible weld seams
   - Steel brackets and reinforcements
5. Let each coat tack up before applying the next (15-30 minutes)

### Step 6: Cavity Wax (Optional but Recommended)

Using a cavity wax can with a long extension tube:

1. Locate access holes in structural members (door sills, rocker panels)
2. Insert the tube as deep as possible
3. Spray while slowly pulling the tube out
4. This creates a thin wax film inside hollow sections

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Warm the cavity wax can in warm water (not hot!) before use. Warmer wax flows better and penetrates deeper.

### Step 7: Let It Cure

- Wax-based: 24-48 hours before driving in rain
- Rubber-based: 48-72 hours for full cure
- Avoid pressure washing the underbody for at least 2 weeks

## Tesla-Specific Concerns

### Battery Pack

The Tesla battery pack covers most of the underbody and is factory-sealed. **Do not attempt to undercoat the battery pack itself.** Focus on the areas around and forward/behind the pack—subframes, suspension mounts, and wheel wells.

### Aluminum + Steel Contact (Galvanic Corrosion)

Where aluminum and steel meet, galvanic corrosion can occur (two dissimilar metals + an electrolyte like salt water). Tesla uses isolating hardware at these junctions, but they can degrade over time. Undercoating these junction points is especially valuable.

### Regenerative Braking and Brake Rust

Because Teslas use [regenerative braking](/tesla-regen-braking-reduced/), the mechanical brakes are used much less than in a gas car. This means:
- Brake rotors develop surface rust faster (less cleaning action from pads)
- The rust is mostly cosmetic but can cause squealing
- Occasionally use the brakes firmly to clean the rotors (safe, empty road)

See our [Tesla Squeaky Brakes Fix Guide](/tesla-squeaky-brakes-fix/) for more on this.

### Underbody Aero Shield

Model 3 and Y have plastic aero shields under the front. These actually help protect the underbody but can trap moisture behind them. During your undercoating session:
1. Remove the aero shield (usually T20 Torx screws and plastic clips)
2. Clean and treat the area behind it
3. Reinstall with fresh clips if any broke

## Professional vs. DIY

| Factor | DIY | Professional |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Cost** | €30-80 in materials | €200-500 |
| **Time** | 4-6 hours | 2-3 hours |
| **Quality** | Good (with care) | Excellent |
| **Cavity wax** | Difficult to reach all areas | Specialized tools reach everywhere |
| **Warranty** | None | Usually 3-5 year guarantee |

**Our verdict:** DIY undercoating is absolutely viable for the underbody. For cavity wax injection, consider a professional—they have specialized spray guns and access tools that reach areas you can't with a rattle can.

In Europe, look for shops specializing in "Unterbodenschutz" (Germany/Austria), "underredsskydd" (Sweden), or just "anti-corrosion treatment."

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| **Underbody wash** | Monthly during salt season |
| **Visual inspection** | Every spring (after salt season) |
| **Wax-based reapplication** | Annually (before winter) |
| **Rubber-based touch-up** | Every 3-5 years |
| **Cavity wax refresh** | Every 3-5 years |
| **Brake rotor cleaning drive** | Monthly in winter |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Applying over dirty/wet surfaces** — the coating won't bond and will trap moisture underneath
2. **Spraying brake components** — compromises braking performance, extremely dangerous
3. **Sealing over existing rust** — this accelerates corrosion; always treat rust first
4. **Using the wrong product on rubber** — some petroleum-based products degrade bushings and seals
5. **Skipping cavity wax** — underbody coating alone misses the most vulnerable areas (insides of structural members)
6. **Forgetting to reapply** — wax-based products are designed to be refreshed annually

## Signs Your Tesla Needs Rust Treatment Now

- Orange/brown stains on subframe or suspension components
- Squealing brakes that won't stop even after hard braking
- Fasteners that won't come loose (corroded threads)
- White powder on aluminum parts (aluminum corrosion)
- Any visible bubbling under paint on steel components
- You've driven 2+ winters without any protection

## Final Thoughts

Rust prevention is the most underrated maintenance task for Teslas, especially in Europe. The car's aluminum body panels create a false sense of security—meanwhile, the steel subframe and suspension components are quietly corroding underneath. A few hours of work and €50-80 in materials can prevent thousands in repair costs down the line.

Start with a thorough underbody wash and inspection. If everything looks clean, apply undercoating now. If you spot rust, treat it first. And make it an annual ritual—your Tesla will thank you with many more years of trouble-free driving.
