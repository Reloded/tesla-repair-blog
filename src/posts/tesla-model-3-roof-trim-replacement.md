The roof trim on your Tesla Model 3 is the chrome or black strip running along the edge of the glass roof. It takes road abuse from car washes, tree branches, and parking garage mishaps. When it gets damaged or you want to do a chrome delete, replacing it is a straightforward DIY job.

Tesla Service wants €300-500 for this repair. You can do it in 30 minutes for the cost of the part.

## When to Replace the Roof Trim

- **Damaged trim** — scratches, dents, or peeling chrome from car washes or impacts
- **Chrome delete** — swapping chrome for black trim on a refresh look
- **Wind noise** — loose or misaligned trim causes whistling at highway speed
- **Glass replacement prep** — trim must come off for roof glass work

## Parts You'll Need

| Part | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Roof trim (driver side) | Part number varies by year and finish |
| Roof trim (passenger side) | Same note as above |
| Yellow retaining clips | Replace any broken ones |

OEM parts available from [RR Car Parts](https://rrcarparts.com) or through Tesla Service.

## Tools Required

- Plastic trim removal tool (don't use metal — you'll scratch the paint)
- T20 Torx screwdriver
- Microfiber cloth
- Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning

## Step-by-Step: Removing the Roof Trim

### Step 1: Locate the Retaining Clips

The trim snaps onto yellow plastic clips that sit in the roof channel. There are about 8-10 clips per side.

*These clips slide into slots in the roof and the trim snaps onto them*

### Step 2: Remove the Torx Screws

Find the T20 Torx screws that secure the trim at the corners and where it meets the B-pillar. There are usually 3-4 screws per side.

*Screw location in the roof channel — these anchor the trim at key points*

### Step 3: Release the Trim

Starting from one end (the rear is usually easier):

1. Slide a plastic trim tool under the edge
2. Gently pry upward to release the first clip
3. Work your way forward, releasing each clip in sequence
4. Don't yank — if something won't release, you missed a screw

The trim comes off as one long curved piece.

### Step 4: Inspect the Roof Channel

With the trim off, check:

- Are any yellow clips cracked or stuck in the trim? Replace them
- Any debris or corrosion in the channel? Clean it out
- Screw holes in good shape? If stripped, you may need slightly larger screws

## Step-by-Step: Installing New Trim

Installation is the reverse of removal, but alignment matters.

### Step 1: Install the Clips

If your new trim came without clips pre-installed, snap the yellow clips onto the trim first. They slide into slots on the underside.

### Step 2: Start at the Front

Align the front end of the trim with the A-pillar (windshield corner). This is your reference point — get it right here and the rest follows.

### Step 3: Snap In the Clips

Press the trim firmly onto the roof edge. You'll feel (and hear) each clip snap into place. Work your way from front to back.

### Step 4: Check the B-Pillar Junction

This is where the roof trim meets the door frame trim. The seam should be tight with no gap.

*Where the roof trim meets the B-pillar — alignment is critical here*

### Step 5: Install the Torx Screws

Put the T20 screws back in. Don't overtighten — snug is enough. The clips do most of the holding work.

## Pro Tips

**Don't work in extreme temperatures.** Cold plastic cracks, hot plastic warps. Room temperature in a garage is ideal.

**Take photos before you start.** If you forget how something goes back together, you'll thank yourself later.

**Replace broken clips.** Loose clips cause rattles and wind noise. They're cheap — don't reuse cracked ones.

**The B-pillar junction takes patience.** It's the one spot where misalignment is visible. Take your time getting it right.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Wind noise after install | Loose clip or misalignment | Reseat that section of trim |
| Trim won't snap in | Debris in channel | Clean with alcohol |
| Screw won't tighten | Stripped hole | Use thread-locking compound or slightly larger screw |
| Gap at B-pillar | Wrong alignment | Remove and re-seat from the front |

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Tesla Service Center | €300-500 |
| Independent body shop | €150-250 |
| DIY | €50-150 (part only) |

**You save: €150-400**

That's real money back in your pocket for 30 minutes of work.
