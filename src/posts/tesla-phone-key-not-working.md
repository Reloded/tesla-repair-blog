The Tesla phone key is convenient when it works, but frustrating when it doesn't. Standing outside your car with a phone that won't unlock it is a common Tesla owner experience. Here's how to diagnose and fix phone key problems for both iPhone and Android.

## How Tesla Phone Key Works

**Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):**
- Phone broadcasts identity via Bluetooth
- Car detects phone within ~3-5 feet
- Unlocks when you pull door handle
- Locks when you walk away

[Bluetooth problems](/posts/tesla-bluetooth-issues/) can directly affect phone key functionality, so troubleshoot Bluetooth first if your phone key is unreliable.

**Requirements:**
- Tesla app installed and logged in
- Bluetooth enabled on phone
- Location services enabled (for app)
- Phone key set up in car's touchscreen

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Backup Keys:</strong> Always carry your key card as backup. Store one in your wallet, purse, or phone case. You can also get a [key fob](/posts/tesla-key-fob-battery/) for more reliability.
