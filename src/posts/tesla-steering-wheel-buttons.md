Tesla's steering wheel scroll wheels and buttons control crucial functions like volume, Autopilot speed, and voice commands. When these become unresponsive or erratic, it affects your driving experience. This guide covers cleaning and troubleshooting these essential controls.

## Common Steering Wheel Button Problems

Identify your issue:

- **Scroll wheel doesn't scroll** - No response when rotating
- **Scroll wheel clicks don't register** - Press not recognized
- **Erratic behavior** - Scrolls in wrong direction or jumps
- **Button presses ignored** - Left/right buttons unresponsive
- **Intermittent response** - Works sometimes, not others

## Understanding the Controls

### Left Scroll Wheel
- **Scroll:** Volume up/down
- **Press:** Voice commands
- **Left/Right buttons:** Previous/Next track

### Right Scroll Wheel
- **Scroll:** Autopilot follow distance
- **Press:** Confirm selection (varies by context)
- **Left/Right buttons:** Autopilot speed adjust

### Both Wheels Together
- **Press both 10 seconds:** System reboot

## Quick Fixes First

### System Reboot

Sometimes buttons become unresponsive due to software glitches:

1. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. Screen goes dark, then Tesla logo appears
3. Wait for full restart (2-3 minutes)
4. Test buttons again

### Check for Software Updates

Updates sometimes fix button responsiveness:

1. Go to **Controls > Software**
2. Install any available updates
3. Test after update completes

## Cleaning the Scroll Wheels

Most scroll wheel problems are caused by dirt, oils, and debris accumulation.

### Basic Cleaning

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>What You'll Need:</strong>
<ul>
<li>99% Isopropyl alcohol</li>
<li>Microfiber cloth</li>
<li>Compressed air</li>
<li>Plastic dental picks (optional)</li>
</ul>
</div>

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Turn off the car** (Controls > Safety > Power Off)
2. **Wait 3 minutes** for systems to power down
3. **Spray compressed air** around the scroll wheel edges
4. **Dampen microfiber cloth** with isopropyl alcohol (not soaking wet)
5. **Wipe around the scroll wheel** circumference
6. **Rotate the wheel** while wiping to clean all surfaces
7. **Use plastic pick** to clean around the edges gently
8. **Let dry** for 2-3 minutes
9. **Wake the car** and test

### Deep Cleaning Technique

For severely stuck scroll wheels:

1. Apply isopropyl alcohol to a cotton swab
2. Rotate the wheel while running the swab around edges
3. Work the alcohol into the gaps
4. Rotate wheel repeatedly while cleaning
5. Use compressed air to blow out debris
6. Repeat 2-3 times if needed

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Never use water or household cleaners on the scroll wheels. Only use 99% isopropyl alcohol which evaporates quickly and won't damage electronics.
</div>

## Button Cleaning

### Side Buttons

The left/right buttons next to each scroll wheel:

1. Use compressed air to blow out debris
2. Wipe with alcohol-dampened cloth
3. Press buttons repeatedly while cleaning
4. Check for improved response

### Common Contamination Sources

- Hand lotions and oils
- Food residue
- Dust and lint
- Dried liquid spills

## Scroll Wheel Calibration

Tesla scroll wheels don't require manual calibration, but you can reset them:

### Soft Reset

1. Perform system reboot (both wheels 10 seconds)
2. After restart, test each function
3. Often resolves erratic behavior

### Full Power Cycle

1. Go to **Controls > Safety > Power Off**
2. Exit the car and close doors
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Open door and press brake to wake
5. Test scroll wheel functions
