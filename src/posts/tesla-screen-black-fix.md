A black or frozen Tesla touchscreen can be alarming, but it's usually an easy fix. The touchscreen is essentially a computer, and like any computer, it occasionally needs a reboot. This guide covers all the reset options from simple to comprehensive.

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Good News:</strong> A frozen or black screen doesn't affect the car's ability to drive safely. Critical systems like steering, brakes, and motor control are on separate computers. You can drive to a safe location and then reboot.
</div>

## Common Screen Issues

- **Completely black screen** - No display at all
- **Frozen screen** - Displays something but won't respond to touch
- **Laggy/slow** - Responds but with significant delay
- **Half the screen blank** - Partial display failure
- **Rebooting loop** - Screen keeps restarting
- **White/gray screen** - Stuck on boot screen

## Level 1: Soft Reboot (Most Common Fix)

The soft reboot is like restarting your phone—it solves most temporary glitches.

### How to Soft Reboot

**While parked (recommended):**

1. Put the car in Park
2. Press and hold **both scroll wheels** on the steering wheel
3. Hold for **10-15 seconds** until the screen goes black
4. Wait for the Tesla logo to appear
5. Release the buttons
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for the system to fully restart

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> You don't need to press the brake or turn anything off. Just hold both scroll wheels. The car remains operational during this reboot.
</div>

**Model S/X with separate instrument cluster:**
- The instrument cluster (behind steering wheel) may stay on during reboot
- If you need to reset that too, see Level 2

### What Does This Fix?

- Frozen touchscreen
- Bluetooth issues
- Navigation problems
- Backup camera not displaying
- Audio glitches
- App responsiveness issues

## Level 2: Hard Reboot (Power Cycle)

If the soft reboot doesn't work, a full power cycle resets more systems.

### How to Hard Reboot

**Step 1:** Put the car in Park

**Step 2:** Go to **Controls > Safety > Power Off** (if screen is responsive)

If screen is not responsive:
- Just exit the car and close all doors
- Don't touch the app or key for 5 minutes

**Step 3:** Wait at least 2-3 minutes with all doors closed

**Step 4:** Open the door or press the brake pedal to wake the car

### What Does This Add?

- Resets the entire vehicle computer system
- Clears more persistent software glitches
- Forces all modules to reinitialize

## Level 3: Scroll Wheel + Brake Reboot

This is a more aggressive version of the soft reboot:

1. Sit in the driver's seat
2. Press and hold the **brake pedal**
3. Press and hold **both scroll wheels**
4. Continue holding both for **20-30 seconds**
5. The screen will go black, then show the Tesla logo
6. Wait for full boot

This resets additional systems that the standard soft reboot misses.

## Level 4: Factory Reset (Last Resort)

A factory reset erases all personal data and settings. Only do this if:
- Other methods don't work
- Tesla Support recommends it
- You're selling the car

### How to Factory Reset

**Via Touchscreen (if responsive):**
1. Go to **Controls > Service > Factory Reset**
2. Enter your Tesla account password
3. Confirm the reset
4. Wait 15-30 minutes for completion

**Via Tesla App (if screen is dead):**
1. Open Tesla app on your phone
2. You cannot fully factory reset from the app, but you can schedule service

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Factory reset erases ALL data including:
- Driver profiles
- Saved addresses
- Bluetooth pairings
- WiFi networks
- Custom settings
- Dashcam footage
You'll need to set everything up again from scratch.

## Specific Scenarios
### Screen Shows Tesla Logo Then Goes Black Again (Persistent)This is a more serious issue that many Model 3 and Model Y owners experience. Symptoms:- You do a soft reset, Tesla logo appears, then screen goes black again- Car is still drivable but no AC, no music, no touchscreen functions- Car shows "offline" in the Tesla app- Interior/exterior lights work fine- Reconnecting the 12V/16V battery does not help**What is happening:** The main computer (MCU) is failing to fully boot. The driving systems work because they run on separate computers, but the infotainment system is stuck in a boot loop.**What to try:**1. **Extended power down:** Exit the car completely, close all doors. Open the Tesla app and do NOT interact with the car. Wait 30-60 minutes (much longer than normal). Open the door and check if screen boots properly.2. **Full battery disconnect (extended):** Disconnect the 12V/16V battery completely. Wait 15-20 minutes with it disconnected (not just a few seconds). Reconnect and wait 5 minutes before opening the door.3. **Scroll wheel + brake hold (extended):** Hold both scroll wheels AND brake pedal. Hold for 60+ seconds (much longer than the normal 10-15 seconds). Wait 5 minutes for full boot attempt.4. **Leave car plugged in overnight:** Connect to charger. Leave overnight without interacting. Sometimes the car will download and install a fix while charging.**If none of these work:** This likely indicates a hardware failure that requires Tesla Service: eMMC failure, MCU board failure, or corrupted firmware that needs service center to reflash.**Typical repair costs:** eMMC chip replacement (third-party) $300-500, MCU1 to MCU2 upgrade $1,500-2,500, MCU2/MCU3 replacement $1,000-1,800, Firmware reflash $0-200.**Tip:** If Tesla quotes you for full MCU replacement, search for "Tesla eMMC repair" in your area. Many specialists can replace just the failed chip for a fraction of the cost.

### Screen Black While Driving

1. **Stay calm** - The car will continue driving safely
2. Try soft reboot (hold both scroll wheels) while driving—this is safe
3. Pull over when convenient to let the system fully restart
4. If it happens repeatedly, schedule service

### Screen Stuck on Tesla Logo

This indicates a boot problem:
1. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes—sometimes it just takes a while
2. Try the scroll wheel + brake reboot
3. If it persists, the car may need a software update via service center

### Half Screen Black or Glitching

This might indicate a hardware problem:
1. Try all reboot methods
2. If it persists, the screen or MCU (Media Control Unit) may need replacement
3. Schedule service—this is not DIY fixable

### Screen Issues After Update

Software updates occasionally cause temporary issues:
1. Let the car sit for 30 minutes to complete the update
2. Soft reboot after the update completes
3. If problems persist for more than a day, contact Tesla

## Preventing Screen Issues

- **Keep software updated** - Updates include bug fixes
- **Avoid extreme temperatures** - Don't leave the car in direct sun with a black interior for hours
- **Don't interrupt updates** - Let them complete fully
- **Restart occasionally** - A weekly soft reboot can prevent buildup of issues

## When to Contact Tesla Service

- Screen issues persist after all reboot types
- Hardware damage is visible (cracks, burn marks)
- MCU replacement is needed (not DIY)
- Issues began after an accident or water exposure

## Common Causes

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Random black screen | Software glitch | Soft reboot |
| Always black at startup | 12V battery low | Replace 12V battery |
| Freezing often | Background app issues | Hard reboot, update software |
| Yellow border/screen | Old MCU failing | MCU replacement (service center) |

*Most Tesla screen issues are solved with a simple soft reboot. Try that first before worrying about anything more serious.*
