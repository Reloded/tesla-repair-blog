Few things are more frustrating than being ready to leave and your Tesla charging cable won't release. Whether you're at home, a Supercharger, or a public charger, a stuck charge port can leave you stranded. Here's how to fix it.

## Why Does the Charge Port Get Stuck?

Common causes:

- **Cold weather** - Ice or frost freezing the latch
- **Software glitch** - Car thinks it's still charging
- **Physical obstruction** - Debris in the port
- **Latch mechanism failure** - Mechanical issue
- **Low 12V battery** - Not enough power to release latch (see [12V battery replacement](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/))
- **Charging session still active** - Charger hasn't ended the session

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### Method 1: Use the App

1. Open the Tesla app
2. Tap **Controls**
3. Tap **Unlock Charge Port**
4. Try removing the cable

### Method 2: Use the Button on the Cable

1. Press the button on the Tesla connector handle
2. While holding the button, try to pull the cable out
3. You should hear a click when it releases

### Method 3: Press the Charge Port Button

1. Tap the charge port door on the car
2. Wait for the light to blink
3. Try removing the cable

### Method 4: Try the Touchscreen

1. Go to **Controls > Charging > Unlock Charge Port**
2. Try removing the cable

### Method 5: Key Fob (If Equipped)

Per Tesla's documentation, if you have a key fob:
1. Press and hold the **rear trunk button** on the key fob for 1-2 seconds
2. Pull the charge cable from the charge port

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Sometimes the car needs a moment to process the unlock command. Wait 5-10 seconds after each attempt before pulling on the cable.
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Do not use the manual release methods while the vehicle is actively charging or if any orange high voltage conductors are exposed. This can result in electric shock and serious injury.
</div>

## Manual Release Methods

If the quick fixes don't work, there's a manual release built into every Tesla.

### Model 3 and Model Y Manual Release

The manual release is located in the trunk:

1. Open the trunk
2. Look on the right side, near the charge port area
3. You'll see a small access panel or carpet section
4. Pull back the carpet/panel to reveal the release mechanism
5. You'll find a **pull cord or tab** (usually a small loop)
6. **Pull the cord** while someone else pulls on the charging cable
7. The cable should release

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Location:</strong> The manual release is on the right side of the trunk, roughly behind the charge port. On some model years, it's hidden under the trunk liner—you may need to pull back the carpet.
</div>

### Model S Manual Release

**Pre-Refresh Model S (2012-2020):**
1. Open the rear passenger door (right side)
2. Look at the door jamb area near the charge port
3. Find the small plastic cover
4. Remove the cover to access the manual release cable
5. Pull the cable while removing the connector

**Refreshed Model S (2021+):**
1. Open the trunk
2. Look for the manual release on the right side
3. Pull the release cord

### Model X Manual Release

1. Open the rear falcon wing door (right side) or trunk
2. Locate the access panel near the charge port area
3. Find the manual release pull cord
4. Pull while someone removes the charging cable

## Cold Weather: Frozen Charge Port

In winter, ice can physically lock the charge port. Here's how to handle it:

### Prevention

1. **Pre-condition before unplugging** - Warm the car through the app before trying to unplug
2. **Use Scheduled Departure** - The car will pre-heat, including the charge port
3. **Park with the charge port facing the sun** (if possible)
4. **Apply silicone lubricant** to the charge port door seal (not inside the port!)

### If Already Frozen

1. **Pre-condition the car** - Turn on climate from the app, wait 15-20 minutes
2. **Pour lukewarm water** - NOT hot water, just lukewarm, around the charge port
3. **Use a hair dryer** - If you have power nearby
4. **Spray de-icer** - Around the edges, not directly into the port
5. **Never force it** - You can damage the latch mechanism

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Never pour boiling water on a frozen charge port or any part of your car. Thermal shock can crack plastic and glass components.
</div>

## After Releasing the Cable

If you had to use the manual release:

1. **Inspect the port** - Look for debris or damage
2. **Test the port** - Try locking and unlocking electronically
3. **Clean if needed** - Use a dry cloth to remove any moisture or debris
4. **Plug in again** - Test if the issue repeats
5. **Consider service** - If it happens repeatedly, there may be a latch issue

## When to Contact Tesla

Schedule service if:

- Manual release doesn't work
- The port is physically damaged
- The issue happens repeatedly
- You see warning messages about the charge port
- The charge port door won't open or close properly

## Common Questions

**Will my car still charge with a stuck cable?**
Yes, typically the car will charge normally even if the cable is stuck. The lock mechanism is separate from the charging system.

**Can I drive with the cable stuck?**
Technically no—you'd be dragging the cable. Wait until you can release it.

**Will Tesla roadside help?**
Yes, Tesla Roadside Assistance can help with a stuck charge port. Call if the manual release doesn't work.

**Is this covered by warranty?**
If there's a mechanical failure, yes. If it's due to ice or user damage, no.

*Keep a small flashlight in your car to help locate the manual release if needed, especially in a dark parking garage.*
