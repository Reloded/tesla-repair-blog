A Tesla frunk that won't open is usually caused by a 12V battery issue or a latch problem. Before panicking, there are several ways to get it open—including emergency releases that don't require any power.

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### Method 1: Use the Tesla App

1. Open the Tesla app
2. Tap **Controls**
3. Tap **Frunk** (front trunk icon)
4. Wait for the frunk to pop open

### Method 2: Touchscreen

1. Tap **Controls** on the touchscreen
2. Tap the **Frunk** button
3. You should hear the latch release

### Method 3: Double-Tap the Frunk

On some models, you can open the frunk by:
1. Standing in front of the car (phone key or key card nearby)
2. Double-tapping the front edge of the frunk
3. Wait for the latch to release

<div class="info-box">
<strong>If None of These Work:</strong> The most likely cause is a dead or dying 12V battery. The frunk latch is electric and requires 12V power. Move on to the emergency release methods below.
</div>

## Emergency Release Methods

### Model 3 Emergency Frunk Release

The Model 3 doesn't have a simple manual release. If the 12V battery is dead, you need to provide external power:

**Step 1: Access the Power Terminals**

1. Remove the tow hook cover on the front bumper (small panel on the right side)
2. You'll see two small wires with terminal connectors

**Step 2: Provide External Power**

Per [Tesla's procedure](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Public/diy/model3/en_us/GUID-FE8439BB-18A6-494B-97A8-FA9063E81DF8.html):

1. Connect a 12V power source (jump pack or another car's battery)
2. Connect positive (+) to the positive terminal
3. Connect negative (-) to the negative terminal
4. The hood latches will release immediately
5. **Important:** Do not leave power cables connected for more than 30 seconds
6. This only releases the latches—it does not charge the 12V battery

**Alternative: The Coat Hanger Method** (requires creativity)
1. Through the wheel well, you can access the frunk release cable
2. This requires removing the wheel well liner partially
3. Pull the release cable to open the frunk
4. This is complex and not recommended unless you're experienced

### Model Y Emergency Frunk Release

Similar to Model 3:

1. Remove the tow hook cover on the front bumper
2. Connect a 12V power source to the terminals
3. Wake the car and use the app/screen to open the frunk

### Model S Emergency Frunk Release

Model S has a manual release:

**Method 1: Under the Nose Cone**
1. Locate the small panel at the bottom of the front fascia
2. Remove the panel with a flat tool
3. Find the manual release cable (loop or handle)
4. Pull to release the frunk latch

**Method 2: Jump Start Terminals**
1. The jump start terminals are also under the nose cone
2. Connect 12V power
3. Open frunk via app/screen

### Model X Emergency Frunk Release

Similar to Model S:

1. Access the panel at the bottom of the front fascia
2. Find the manual release cable
3. Pull to release
4. Or use jump start terminals to power the car

## Why Won't My Frunk Open?

### Cause 1: Dead 12V Battery

**Symptoms:**
- Car won't wake up
- No response from app
- Touchscreen is black
- Door handles don't present (Model S/X)

**Fix:** Provide external 12V power and then [replace the 12V battery](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/)

### Cause 2: Frunk Latch Issue

**Symptoms:**
- Car is responsive, but frunk specifically won't open
- You hear clicking but nothing happens
- Works sometimes, fails sometimes

**Fix:**
- Try lubricating the latch mechanism
- If that doesn't work, the latch motor may need replacement

### Cause 3: Alignment Issue

**Symptoms:**
- Frunk is hard to close
- Makes popping or scraping sounds
- Appears misaligned

**Fix:**
- Frunk alignment can be adjusted (loosen hood bolts, adjust, retighten)
- If damage occurred, may need body work

### Cause 4: Cold Weather

**Symptoms:**
- Works fine in warm weather
- Fails or struggles in freezing temps
- Ice visible around seals

**Fix:**
- Pre-condition the car to warm it up
- Use de-icer spray on the seal edges
- Gently push down on the frunk while activating the release

## Lubricating the Frunk Latch

If the frunk opens slowly or makes grinding sounds:

1. Open the frunk
2. Locate the latch mechanism at the front edge
3. Clean any debris with a dry cloth
4. Apply silicone lubricant to:
   - The latch striker
   - Moving parts of the latch mechanism
   - The rubber seal (lightly)
5. Open and close the frunk several times to distribute

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Lubricate the frunk and trunk latches every 6-12 months to prevent sticking, especially if you live in a dusty or humid area.
</div>

## Adjusting Frunk Alignment

If the frunk isn't sitting flush:

1. Open the frunk fully
2. Locate the hood hinge bolts (where the hood connects to the car)
3. Loosen the bolts slightly (don't remove)
4. Adjust the hood position
5. Have someone hold it in the correct position
6. Retighten the bolts
7. Test closure and alignment

**Note:** Frunk adjustment can be tricky. If you're not confident, this is a quick job for any body shop.

## When to Contact Tesla Service

- Frunk won't open after trying all methods
- Latch motor is clearly failed (no sound, no movement)
- Physical damage to the hood or latch area
- Repeated failures even with a good 12V battery
- Warranty may cover frunk latch issues

## Preventing Future Issues

1. **Monitor 12V battery health** - Replace proactively every 4-5 years
2. **Keep latch lubricated** - Quick spray every 6 months
3. **Don't slam the frunk** - Close gently with even pressure
4. **Check alignment periodically** - Ensure smooth operation

*Keep a small jump pack in your garage. It's invaluable for any car, but especially for a Tesla where the frunk contains your charging cables.*
