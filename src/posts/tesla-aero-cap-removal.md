Tesla's aero wheel covers (also called aero caps or hubcaps) improve efficiency by making the wheels more aerodynamic. Many owners prefer the look of the underlying wheels without the covers. Removing and installing them is one of the simplest "modifications" you can do—no tools required.

## Why Remove Aero Caps?

**Aesthetic reasons:**
- Many prefer the look of the "naked" wheels underneath
- Allows customization with center caps and lug nut covers
- Creates a more sporty appearance

**Practical reasons:**
- Makes tire pressure checks easier
- Allows better brake cooling
- Easier visual brake inspection

**Keep in mind:**
- Removing aero caps reduces range by approximately 3-5%
- At highway speeds, the difference is more noticeable
- For maximum efficiency, keep them on

## Removing Tesla Aero Caps

No tools needed—this is a 30-second job per wheel.

### Step-by-Step Removal

1. **Position yourself** at the wheel you want to remove
2. **Find the notch** on the outer edge of the aero cap
3. **Hook your fingers** into the notch
4. **Pull firmly outward** while rotating slightly
5. The cap will pop off with gentle effort
6. Repeat for remaining wheels

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If the cap is stuck, pulling at the notch while walking around the wheel (rotating your pull) usually frees it easily.
</div>

### What You'll See Underneath

Without aero caps, the Model 3/Y wheels reveal:
- Silver 18" Aero wheels with 5 spokes
- Exposed lug nuts
- Valve stem visible
- No center cap (just a hole)

## Installing Aero Caps

Installation is just as easy as removal.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Align the cap** with the wheel (notch facing any direction)
2. **Center over the wheel**
3. **Push firmly** until all clips snap into place
4. **Walk around** pressing edges to ensure secure fit
5. You should hear/feel multiple clicks as clips engage

### Check for Secure Fit

- No rattling when you shake the cap
- Edges sit flush with wheel
- All retention clips are engaged
- Cap doesn't spin freely on wheel

## Improving the Look Without Aero Caps

If you remove your aero caps, you might want to dress up the exposed wheels:

### Center Caps

The naked wheel has an open center. Options:
- **Tesla center caps** with logo
- **Aftermarket colored caps**
- **Carbon fiber style caps**

Installation: Push-fit into center hole.

### Lug Nut Covers

The exposed lug nuts don't look great. Solutions:
- **Chrome lug nut covers**
- **Black lug nut covers** (popular choice)
- **Colored accent covers**

Installation: Press onto each lug nut.

### Aftermarket Wheel Covers

If you want the efficiency benefits but different style:
- Many third-party aero covers available
- Different designs and colors
- Similar efficiency to Tesla originals
- Price range: €80-200 per set

## Aero Cap Storage

If you remove your caps, store them properly:

1. **Stack with soft material between** each cap
2. **Store flat** to prevent warping
3. **Keep indoors** away from temperature extremes
4. **Original box** is perfect if you kept it
5. **Label** if you have multiple Tesla vehicles

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Don't store aero caps standing on edge for long periods—they may warp and not fit properly when reinstalled.
</div>

## Efficiency Impact

Tesla designed aero caps to improve aerodynamics. Without them:

| Speed | Range Impact |
|-------|--------------|
| City driving | ~2% reduction |
| Highway (100 km/h) | ~3-4% reduction |
| Highway (130 km/h) | ~5% reduction |

For daily city driving, the difference is minimal. For road trips with lots of highway driving, the range difference becomes more meaningful.

## Common Questions

### Can I mix aero caps with naked wheels?

Technically yes, but it looks odd. Most owners go all-on or all-off.

### Will removing aero caps void warranty?

No. Aero caps are designed to be removable and this doesn't affect warranty.

### Are there efficiency alternatives that look better?

Yes—third-party aero wheel covers offer similar efficiency with different aesthetics.

### Can I paint my aero caps?

Yes. Use plastic-rated paint after proper prep. Popular options include matte black, gloss black, or body-color matching.

### My aero cap rattles—how to fix?

- Check all clips are engaged
- Look for cracked or broken clips
- Add foam tape to inside of cap for snugger fit
- Replace if clips are damaged

## Model 3 vs Model Y Aero Caps

The wheels and caps are similar but not identical:
- Model 3 18" Aero wheels
- Model Y 19" Gemini wheels (different design)

Make sure replacement covers match your specific model.

## Aero Cap Alternatives

### For Model 3

- Original Tesla aero caps (reinstall if removed)
- Sport wheel upgrade (Tesla option)
- Aftermarket covers (many styles)

### For Model Y

- Gemini covers (original)
- Induction wheel upgrade (Tesla option)
- Third-party covers
