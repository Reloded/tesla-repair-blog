**You're cruising on Autopilot, nothing ahead, and the car slams the brakes.** That's phantom braking — and yes, it's still happening in 2026. Tesla's improved it but hasn't fixed it. Here's what triggers it and the settings that actually help.

## What Is Phantom Braking?

Phantom braking is when your Tesla suddenly slows down or brakes hard without any visible reason. This typically happens when:

- Using Autopilot or Full Self-Driving (FSD)
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active
- Driving on highways, especially under overpasses
- Approaching shadows or changes in road surface

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety Note:</strong> While phantom braking is annoying and potentially dangerous, it's a result of the car being cautious. Always keep your hands on the wheel and be ready to take over when using any driver assistance features.
</div>

## Why Does It Happen?

### Technical Causes

**Camera-Based Vision:**
Tesla removed radar from newer vehicles (2021+), relying solely on cameras. While cameras are improving, they can misinterpret:
- Shadows from overpasses
- Road surface changes
- Signs and billboards
- Sun glare
- Lane markings

**Neural Network Interpretation:**
The car's neural network sometimes sees patterns that don't exist or misidentifies objects:
- A shadow interpreted as an obstacle
- A sign read as something in the road
- Bridge joints seen as stopped vehicles

**Previous Incidents:**
Tesla's fleet learning means the car sometimes "remembers" phantom obstacles from other vehicles' experiences at specific locations.

### Common Triggers

| Trigger | Why It Happens |
|---------|---------------|
| Overpasses | Shadow interpreted as obstacle |
| Bridges | Expansion joints look like objects |
| Road signs | Reflections or proximity confusion |
| Trucks in adjacent lanes | Interpreted as entering your lane |
| Road surface changes | Color/texture change detected |
| Sunset/sunrise | Low sun angle confuses cameras |
| Rain/snow | Visibility issues |

## Fixes and Workarounds

### Fix 1: Keep Cameras Clean

Dirty cameras are a major cause of phantom braking:

1. **Clean windshield regularly** - Inside and out
2. **Clean camera housings** - Pillar cameras, B-pillar cameras
3. **Check for water spots** - Can cause distortion
4. **Replace worn wipers** - Streaks affect camera visibility

**Camera locations to clean:**
- Front cameras (behind windshield at top)
- B-pillar cameras (both sides)
- Fender cameras (both sides)
- Rear camera

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a camera lens cleaner and microfiber cloth. Avoid household glass cleaners which can leave residue.
</div>

### Fix 2: Recalibrate Cameras

Sometimes cameras need recalibration:

1. Go to **Controls > Service > Camera Calibration**
2. Select **Clear Calibration**
3. Drive on well-marked roads for 20-100 miles
4. The car will recalibrate automatically (see our [camera calibration guide](/posts/tesla-autopilot-camera-calibration/) for details)

**When to recalibrate:**
- After windshield replacement
- If you notice increased phantom braking
- After any front-end body work
- Periodically (every 6-12 months)

### Fix 3: Adjust Autopilot Settings

Changing settings can reduce phantom braking severity:

**Following Distance:**
- Increase following distance (1-7 setting)
- Higher number = more space = gentler braking

**Speed Offset:**
- Using "Speed Limit" mode vs. "Current Speed" mode
- Some users report fewer issues at lower speed offsets

**Disable Traffic Light/Sign Control:**
- FSD Beta users can try toggling this off temporarily
- Reduces complexity of what system is analyzing

### Fix 4: Software Updates

Tesla continuously improves Autopilot/FSD:

1. Keep your software up to date
2. Check for pending updates: **Controls > Software**
3. Enable **Advanced** updates for latest improvements
4. Note which software versions improve phantom braking

### Fix 5: Report Issues to Tesla

Tesla uses fleet data to improve:

1. **Use voice command:** "Bug report, phantom braking"
2. This flags the location for Tesla to analyze
3. Over time, known problem spots get addressed
4. The more reports, the faster fixes come

## Driving Strategies to Minimize Impact

### Anticipate Problem Areas

Learn where phantom braking typically occurs:
- Under overpasses
- Near large road signs
- Where shadows cross the road
- At bridge expansion joints
- Near construction zones

When approaching these areas:
- Hover foot over accelerator
- Be ready to override
- Consider disengaging Autopilot temporarily

### Use Autopilot Wisely

**Best conditions for Autopilot:**
- Clear weather
- Well-marked highways
- Moderate traffic
- Clean cameras

**Consider manual driving when:**
- Low sun angle (sunset/sunrise)
- Heavy rain or snow
- Construction zones
- Unfamiliar roads with poor markings

### Night Driving

Phantom braking can actually be less common at night because:
- No shadows
- Headlights illuminate objects clearly
- Less visual clutter

However, wet roads at night can cause issues from reflections.

## When Phantom Braking Is Dangerous

Take extra precautions when:

1. **Vehicles following closely** - Risk of rear-end collision
2. **High-speed highways** - Sudden braking is more dangerous
3. **Trucks behind you** - Longer stopping distances
4. **Wet or icy roads** - Braking can cause loss of control

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> If a car is tailgating you while on Autopilot, consider turning it off. A phantom brake event with someone close behind is dangerous.
</div>

## Documenting Incidents

If you experience frequent phantom braking:

1. **Install a dash cam** - Documents what the cameras saw
2. **Note the location** - GPS coordinates if possible
3. **Note conditions** - Weather, lighting, time of day
4. **Screenshot software version** - Helps track improvements

This documentation is useful for:
- Tesla service appointments
- NHTSA complaints if severe
- Tracking your own patterns

## Tesla's Improvements Over Time

Tesla has made significant progress:

**Radar Era (Pre-2021):**
- Radar sometimes conflicted with camera data
- Overpasses caused radar reflections
- More false positives from radar interference

**Vision Only (2021+):**
- More consistent but initially more phantom braking
- Continuous neural network improvements
- Fleet learning from billions of miles

**Recent Updates:**
- Improved overpass detection
- Better shadow handling
- Reduced false positives from signs
- Smoother braking when events do occur

## Cost

This guide focuses on free fixes. However:

| Solution | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Camera cleaning | ~$10 (supplies) |
| Camera recalibration | Free (built-in) |
| Software updates | Free |
| Dash cam for documentation | $50-200 |
| Professional calibration (if needed) | $100-200 |

## What Tesla Owners Say Works Best

From community experience:

1. **Keep cameras spotless** - Single biggest factor
2. **Update software immediately** - Each version typically improves
3. **Increase follow distance** - More reaction time
4. **Learn your problem spots** - Anticipate and prepare
5. **Report every incident** - Helps Tesla improve

*Phantom braking is frustrating, but it's improving with every software update. The best approach is a combination of keeping cameras clean, staying updated, and being prepared to take over. Remember: Autopilot is driver assistance, not autonomous driving.*
