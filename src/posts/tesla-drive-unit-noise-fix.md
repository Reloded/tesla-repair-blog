A whining, humming, or grinding noise from your Tesla's drive unit is a common concern, especially at higher mileages. The good news: in many cases, a simple gearbox fluid change can dramatically reduce or eliminate the noise. Tesla drive units use a single-speed reduction gear, and over time the fluid degrades, leading to increased gear noise.

## Identifying Drive Unit Noise

**What it sounds like:**
- High-pitched whine that increases with speed
- Humming or droning at highway speeds
- Grinding or growling during acceleration or deceleration

**When to worry:**
- Noise that suddenly gets louder
- Vibration accompanying the noise
- Metallic grinding or clunking sounds (this may indicate bearing failure — see a professional)

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Quick Test:</strong> Put the car in neutral while coasting. If the noise goes away, it's drive unit related. If it persists, it may be a <a href="/posts/tesla-wheel-bearing-replacement/">wheel bearing issue</a> instead.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 1–2 hours
**Skill Level:** Intermediate

**Fluid to Buy:**

Tesla uses a specific gearbox fluid (Pentosin ATF 9). The rear drive unit on Model 3/Y takes approximately **1.1 liters**, the front unit about **0.9 liters**.

- **Pentosin ATF 9** (~$25–35/liter) — Tesla OEM spec
- **New crush washers/O-rings** for drain and fill plugs (~$5)

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $50–80 | $200–400 | $250–480 |
| Independent Shop | $50–80 | $100–200 | $150–280 |
| DIY | $50–80 | Your time | $50–80 |

**Your savings: $100–400**

## Step-by-Step: Gearbox Fluid Change

### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle

1. Drive the car for 10–15 minutes to warm up the fluid (warm fluid drains better)
2. Park on a flat surface and enable **Jack Mode** (Controls > Service > Jack Mode)
3. Lift the vehicle and secure on jack stands at proper [jack points](/posts/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/)
4. Remove the rear aero shield panel if working on the rear drive unit

### Step 2: Locate Drain and Fill Plugs

**Rear Drive Unit (Model 3/Y):**
- **Drain plug:** Bottom of the drive unit housing (8mm Allen)
- **Fill plug:** Side of the drive unit housing (8mm Allen)

**Front Drive Unit (Dual Motor):**
- **Drain plug:** Bottom of the front drive unit
- **Fill plug:** Side of the unit, with an oil filter nearby

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Always remove the FILL plug first. If you can't get the fill plug out, you won't be able to refill — and you don't want to be stuck with a drained drive unit.
</div>

### Step 3: Drain the Old Fluid

1. Place the drain pan under the drive unit
2. Remove the **fill plug** first (8mm Allen)
3. Remove the **drain plug** (8mm Allen) — fluid will flow out
4. Allow fluid to drain completely (5–10 minutes)
5. Inspect the old fluid — it should be reddish. Dark brown or metallic particles indicate wear

### Step 4: Replace Oil Filter (Front Drive Unit Only)

The front drive unit has an external oil filter:

1. Unscrew the old filter (hand-tight, counterclockwise)
2. Apply a thin coat of new fluid to the new filter's O-ring
3. Install the new filter hand-tight, then tighten to **3 Nm (2 ft-lbs)**

### Step 5: Refill with New Fluid

1. Install the drain plug with a new crush washer
2. **Rear drive unit drain/fill plug torque: 28 Nm (21 ft-lbs)**
3. **Front drive unit fill plug torque: 15 Nm (11 ft-lbs)**
4. Using a fluid transfer pump, fill through the fill hole until fluid begins to seep out
5. Install the fill plug and torque to spec

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A hand pump with a flexible hose makes filling much easier when working under the car. Fill slowly to avoid air pockets.
</div>

### Step 6: Final Checks

1. Wipe down the drive unit to remove any spilled fluid
2. Reinstall the aero shield panel
3. Lower the vehicle
4. Drive for 10–15 minutes and listen for improvement
5. Check under the car for any leaks

## Torque Specifications Summary

| Fastener | Torque |
|----------|--------|
| Rear drive unit drain plug (8mm Allen) | 28 Nm (21 ft-lbs) |
| Rear drive unit fill plug (8mm Allen) | 28 Nm (21 ft-lbs) |
| Front drive unit fill plug (8mm Allen) | 15 Nm (11 ft-lbs) |
| Front drive unit oil filter | 3 Nm (2 ft-lbs) |
| Oil pump to drive unit bolts | 5 Nm (4 ft-lbs) |

## When a Fluid Change Won't Help

If the noise persists after a fluid change, the issue may be:

- **Worn bearings** in the drive unit — requires drive unit rebuild or replacement
- **Gear tooth wear** — typically only on very high-mileage vehicles
- **Halfshaft issues** — clicking during turns indicates a different problem (see our [halfshaft clicking fix](/posts/tesla-halfshaft-clicking-fix/))

Drive unit replacement at Tesla costs $5,000–$9,000. A rebuilt unit from a specialist costs $2,000–$4,000. Always try the fluid change first — it's a $50–80 gamble that often pays off.
