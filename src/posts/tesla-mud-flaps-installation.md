Mud flaps are one of the best bang-for-your-buck accessories you can add to your Tesla Model 3 or Model Y. They protect your paint, rocker panels, and doors from rock chips, road salt, mud, and debris—all for under $40 and about 30 minutes of work. Yet Tesla doesn't include them from the factory, and many owners don't realize how much damage accumulates without them until it's too late.

This guide covers everything you need to know about choosing and installing mud flaps on your Model 3 or Model Y, including the differences between OEM and aftermarket options, the front vs. rear installation process, and model-year-specific considerations.

## Why Your Tesla Needs Mud Flaps

If you've ever looked at the rocker panels and rear quarter panels on a Tesla that's been driven through a winter or two without mud flaps, you'll see the evidence: rock chips, salt stains, and paint damage that no amount of washing will fix.

**What mud flaps protect against:**

- **Rock chips** — Small stones kicked up by the front tires impact the rocker panels, doors, and rear quarter panels. Over time, this causes visible paint damage.
- **Road salt and brine** — In winter climates, salt spray accelerates corrosion and eats into clear coat. Mud flaps redirect this spray downward.
- **Mud and sand** — Dirty roads send debris flying across your entire side profile.
- **Snow and slush** — Winter driving without mud flaps coats the sides of your car in grimy slush.

**The real cost of skipping them:**

Paint correction or touch-up for rock chip damage on Tesla's multi-coat paint can easily cost €200–500+. A full rocker panel respray runs even more. Mud flaps cost €20–40 and prevent most of this damage. It's one of those rare accessories where the ROI is almost immediate.

## Tesla OEM vs. Aftermarket Mud Flaps

Before you install, you need to decide what to buy. There are two main paths: Tesla's official mud flaps from the Tesla Shop, or aftermarket options from brands like Basenor, BMZX, RPM Tesla, and others.

### Tesla OEM Mud Flaps

Tesla sells official mud flap kits through [shop.tesla.com](https://shop.tesla.com):

- **Model 3 Mud Flaps** — Front only (2 pieces), compatible with 2024+ Highland models
- **Model Y Mud Flaps** — Front only (2 pieces), compatible with all Model Y vehicles
- **Price:** Approximately $35–45 USD / €35–45

**Pros:**
- Perfect fitment guaranteed
- Co-molded bi-material design (hard plastic mounting + flexible thermoplastic flap)
- OEM-quality push clips included
- Clean, factory-look appearance
- Tesla service manual installation instructions available

**Cons:**
- Front only — no rear mud flaps offered
- Only available for current models (pre-2024 Model 3 kit was discontinued)
- More expensive than aftermarket 4-piece sets

### Aftermarket Mud Flaps (Basenor, BMZX, RPM Tesla, etc.)

Aftermarket options are extremely popular because they offer 4-piece sets covering both front and rear:

- **Basenor** — One of the most popular options on Amazon. Available for Model 3 (2017–2023), Model 3 Highland (2024+), and Model Y. Typically €20–30 for a set of 4.
- **BMZX** — Similar quality and pricing to Basenor, with slightly different mounting hardware.
- **RPM Tesla** — Premium aftermarket option with flexible, bendable design. Fits all Model 3 and Model Y variants including Highland and Juniper.
- **EVBASE** — Budget-friendly 4-piece sets with no-drill installation for most models.

**Pros:**
- 4-piece sets (front + rear) for comprehensive protection
- Significantly cheaper than buying OEM
- Many options available for all model years
- No-drill options available for most configurations

**Cons:**
- Fitment can vary — some require minor adjustments
- Material quality is generally lower than OEM (single-material molding)
- Push clips may be lower quality and can strip more easily
- Some kits require drilling for pre-2024 Model 3

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Our recommendation:</strong> If you only want fronts and have a 2024+ Model 3 or any Model Y, the Tesla OEM kit offers the best fitment and quality. If you want full coverage (front + rear), go aftermarket — Basenor and RPM Tesla are the most consistently well-reviewed options.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Parts:**
- Mud flap kit (OEM or aftermarket) — includes flaps and mounting hardware
- Extra push clips (recommended — they're easy to break during install)

**Tools:**
- Push clip removal tool or flat-head screwdriver
- Isopropyl alcohol and clean cloth (for surface prep)
- Phillips head screwdriver (for some aftermarket kits)
- Trim removal tool / plastic pry tool
- Gloves (cut-resistant recommended for Highland models — the wheel arch liner edges can be sharp)

**Nice to have:**
- Creeper or cardboard to lie on
- Flashlight or headlamp
- Jack and jack stands (for rear installation on some kits)

## Installation: Front Mud Flaps

Front mud flaps are the most important — the front tires are responsible for kicking up the majority of road debris. The installation process differs slightly between model years.

### Model 3 (2017–2023) — Front Installation

The pre-Highland Model 3 uses a combination of screws and push clips, depending on which generation kit you have.

**1st Generation Kits (screws only):**

1. **Turn the steering wheel fully** to the left (for right side) or right (for left side) to expose the wheel arch liner.
2. **Clean the mounting area** with isopropyl alcohol and let it dry completely.
3. **Locate the existing push clips** on the lower front wheel arch liner — you'll see 2 clips that need to be removed.
4. **Remove the push clips** using a push clip removal tool or flat-head screwdriver. Pull the center pin out first, then remove the clip body.
5. **Position the mud flap** against the wheel arch liner, aligning the mounting holes.
6. **Install the screws** (2x) with washers through the mud flap and into the U-nuts in the wheel arch liner.
7. **Tighten to 1.5 Nm (1 ft-lbs)** — don't overtighten or you'll strip the U-nuts.

**2nd Generation Kits (screws + push clips):**

1. Follow steps 1–4 above.
2. **Install the screws** (2x) with washers as above, tightening to 1.5 Nm.
3. **Additionally, align the push clip holes** in the mud flap to the holes in the wheel arch liner.
4. **Insert the push clips** with the plastic rivet pulled out (open position), push into the hole, then press the rivet in to lock.

### Model 3 Highland (2024+) — Front Installation

The Highland Model 3 uses a simpler push-clip-only design:

1. **Clean the installation area** with isopropyl alcohol and allow to fully dry.
2. **Turn the steering wheel fully** to expose the working area.
3. **Remove the existing lower push clips** (2x) from the front wheel arch liner using a push clip removal tool.
4. **Position the mud flap** onto the wheel arch liner and rocker cover, aligning the mounting holes.
5. **Secure with the new push clips** (2x) provided in the kit.
6. **Verify fitment** — ensure the mud flap sits flush against the body and doesn't contact the tire when turning the steering wheel lock-to-lock.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Tesla recommends wearing cut-resistant gloves during Highland mud flap installation. The wheel arch liner edges can be sharp enough to cause cuts.
</div>

### Model Y (All Years) — Front Installation

The Model Y front installation is very similar to the Highland Model 3, using push clips:

1. **Clean the installation area** with isopropyl alcohol. Let it dry completely — adhesion matters if your kit includes mounting tape.
2. **Turn the steering wheel fully** to one side to access the wheel arch.
3. **Remove the existing push clips** (2x) from the lower front wheel arch liner. Use a trim removal tool to pry out the center pin, then remove the clip body.
4. **Position the mud flap** against the wheel arch liner and body. Make sure the flap is oriented correctly — it should follow the contour of the wheel arch.
5. **Insert the new push clips** into the inboard hole first (open position with rivet pulled out), push in, then press the rivet to lock. Repeat for the outboard hole.
6. **Check clearance** — turn the wheels lock-to-lock to ensure no tire contact.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you're having trouble aligning the push clip holes, use a small flashlight behind the wheel arch liner to see the holes more clearly. Sometimes road grime obscures them.
</div>

## Installation: Rear Mud Flaps

Rear mud flaps are only available from aftermarket manufacturers — Tesla doesn't sell rear mud flaps for Model 3 or Model Y. The rear installation is generally easier than the front but varies more between aftermarket brands.

### General Rear Installation Process

Most aftermarket rear mud flaps use one of these mounting methods:

**Push clip method (most common):**

1. **Locate the mounting points** on the rear wheel arch liner. Most kits utilize existing holes in the liner.
2. **Clean the area** with isopropyl alcohol.
3. **Position the rear mud flap** — it typically tucks between the wheel arch liner and the body panel.
4. **Secure with push clips** (usually 2–3 per side) through the pre-existing holes.
5. **Some kits include adhesive tape** as additional security — apply this to the body-contact surface for extra hold.

**Screw method (some Basenor kits):**

1. **Remove the rear wheel** (recommended for better access, though not always required).
2. **Position the mud flap** and mark the screw holes.
3. **Some kits require drilling** into the wheel arch liner — use the provided template and drill bit.
4. **Install self-tapping screws** through the mud flap and into the liner.
5. **Reinstall the wheel** and torque lug nuts to 175 Nm (129 ft-lbs).

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> If your aftermarket kit requires drilling, proceed carefully. You're drilling into plastic wheel arch liner, not body metal — but you still want clean, properly-sized holes to prevent cracking.
</div>

### Model 3 vs. Model Y: Rear Differences

- **Model Y** rear mud flaps generally have an easier installation because the wheel arch is larger and more accessible.
- **Model 3** rear arches are tighter, making alignment more fiddly. Some owners report needing to slightly bend or trim aftermarket flaps for a proper fit.
- **Highland Model 3** (2024+) has a redesigned rear bumper and wheel arch — make sure your kit specifically supports the Highland if you have one.

## Common Installation Issues and Fixes

### Push Clips Breaking or Stripping

This is the #1 complaint, especially with aftermarket kits. The plastic rivets can break if you push too hard or at the wrong angle.

**Fix:** Order extra push clips before you start. Amazon sells universal Tesla push clip sets cheaply. OEM push clips from Tesla are more robust than aftermarket ones.

### Mud Flap Not Sitting Flush

If the flap sticks out or doesn't follow the body contour:

**Fix:** Check that you haven't installed it upside down or on the wrong side (left vs. right). If it's a fitment issue with an aftermarket flap, gentle heating with a heat gun (low setting) can help you reshape the flap slightly. Some owners also use 3M automotive mounting tape to secure loose edges.

### Scraping Noise When Turning

If you hear rubbing when turning the steering wheel fully:

**Fix:** The mud flap is likely too close to the tire. Reposition it slightly outward or trim the inner edge. This is more common with aftermarket flaps that are slightly oversized.

### Flap Coming Loose Over Time

Push clips can vibrate loose over months of driving.

**Fix:** Check your mud flaps periodically — once per tire rotation is a good cadence. Tighten or replace any loose push clips. Adding a small amount of automotive adhesive tape behind the flap provides extra security.

## Winter Protection: Why Mud Flaps Matter Most in Cold Climates

If you live in a climate where roads are salted in winter, mud flaps go from "nice to have" to "essential." Here's what salt and brine do to an unprotected Tesla:

- **Clear coat damage** — Road salt chemically attacks clear coat, leading to dull spots and eventual peeling.
- **Rock chip exposure** — Once salt gets into rock chips, it accelerates rust formation on any exposed metal.
- **Undercarriage corrosion** — While Tesla's aluminum body panels resist rust, steel components (suspension bolts, subframe brackets) can corrode.
- **Wheel well buildup** — Salt-laden slush accumulates in wheel wells and keeps surfaces damp, extending the corrosion window.

Mud flaps significantly reduce the amount of salt spray that reaches your rocker panels and doors. They won't eliminate it entirely — that's what regular winter washing and ceramic coatings are for — but they reduce the damage by roughly 60–70% based on owner reports.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Winter tip:</strong> Combine mud flaps with paint protection film (PPF) on the rocker panels and rear quarter panels for the ultimate winter protection setup. The mud flaps handle the big debris; the PPF handles what gets through.
</div>

## Before and After: What to Expect

**Before mud flaps:**
- Visible rock chips along rocker panels after 6–12 months
- Salt stains and spray marks on doors after winter driving
- Road grime coating the entire side profile
- Sand and gravel damage on rear quarter panels

**After mud flaps:**
- Dramatically cleaner rocker panels and doors
- Rock chips reduced by 60–80% (front flaps) and 40–60% (rear flaps)
- Less frequent need for paint correction
- Your car stays cleaner between washes
- Peace of mind in winter conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do mud flaps affect Tesla's range or aerodynamics?

Minimally. Tesla's own OEM mud flaps are designed to have negligible aerodynamic impact. Aftermarket flaps that sit flush against the body are similar. You might see a 0.5–1% range reduction at highway speeds in the worst case, but most owners report no measurable difference.

### Will mud flaps void my Tesla warranty?

No. Mud flaps are a standard vehicle accessory. Tesla even sells them officially through the Tesla Shop. Installing them won't affect your warranty.

### Do I need to remove the wheel to install mud flaps?

For front mud flaps: no. Turning the steering wheel fully to one side provides enough access. For rear mud flaps: usually no, but some aftermarket kits recommend it for easier access. If you do remove wheels, torque the lug nuts to 175 Nm (129 ft-lbs) when reinstalling.

### Can I go through a car wash with mud flaps installed?

Yes. Both OEM and quality aftermarket mud flaps are designed to withstand automatic car washes. Touchless washes are always preferred for Tesla's paint, with or without mud flaps.

### Should I get front-only or a full set of four?

Front mud flaps provide the most protection since the front tires are the primary source of road debris. However, a full set of four provides the best overall protection, especially for the rear quarter panels. If budget allows, go with the 4-piece aftermarket set.

### My aftermarket mud flaps look different from the pictures — is this normal?

Amazon aftermarket brands frequently update their mold designs. Minor cosmetic differences between product photos and the actual product are common. What matters is proper fitment and secure mounting. If the mounting holes don't align or the shape is completely wrong, return them.

### Do the Tesla OEM mud flaps fit the Model 3 Highland?

Tesla's current Model 3 mud flap kit on shop.tesla.com is listed as compatible with 2024+ (Highland) models only. The pre-2024 Model 3 kit has been discontinued. For pre-2024 Model 3s, aftermarket options are your best bet.

### How long does installation take?

Front mud flaps: 10–15 minutes per side. Rear mud flaps (aftermarket): 15–20 minutes per side. Total for all four: about 45–60 minutes for a first-timer. Once you've done it, subsequent installations (after tire changes, etc.) take half the time.

## Final Thoughts

Installing mud flaps is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to protect your Tesla's paint and body. It requires no special skills, minimal tools, and under an hour of your time. Whether you go with Tesla's OEM fronts or a full aftermarket set, your future self will thank you the first time you drive through a construction zone or a salty winter road without worrying about your paint.
