Tesla's Climate Keeper features help maintain comfortable cabin temperatures when the car is parked. This guide covers common issues with Dog Mode, Camp Mode, and Cabin Overheat Protection.

## Understanding Climate Keeper Features

### Dog Mode
- Keeps cabin at set temperature
- Displays message on screen for passersby
- Designed for leaving pets safely in the car

### Camp Mode
- Maintains climate, powers outlets
- Keeps entertainment system active
- For sleeping/resting in the car

### Cabin Overheat Protection
- Prevents extreme cabin temperatures
- Runs automatically when parked
- Protects interior from heat damage

## Dog Mode Troubleshooting

### Dog Mode Won't Turn On

Common reasons Dog Mode is unavailable:

1. **Battery too low** - Requires above 20% charge
2. **Car not in Park** - Must be stationary
3. **Doors unlocked** - Security requirement
4. **Windows open** - Must be fully closed

**To Enable Dog Mode:**
1. Park the car
2. Tap the fan icon on screen
3. Select **Dog** from the bottom options
4. Set your desired temperature
5. Exit and lock the car

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Never leave pets in the car without verifying Dog Mode is active on the display. Set a reminder to check periodically through the Tesla app.
</div>

### Dog Mode Turns Off Unexpectedly

This happens when:

- **Battery drops below 20%** - System shuts down to preserve battery
- **Door is opened** - Triggers security deactivation
- **Car is unlocked** via app or key
- **Software glitch** - Rare but possible

**Prevention Tips:**
- Start with battery above 50%
- Only use key card (less likely to accidentally unlock)
- Set phone notifications to alert on climate changes

### Screen Message Not Showing

If the display doesn't show "My owner will be back soon":

1. Ensure Dog Mode (not just climate) is selected
2. Check screen brightness isn't too low
3. Reboot if message doesn't appear
4. Report bug if consistently failing

## Camp Mode Issues

### Camp Mode Requirements

Camp Mode needs:

- **Battery above 15%** to activate
- **Car in Park** and stationary
- **All doors closed** for full functionality

### Power Outlets Not Working in Camp Mode

If USB-C or 12V outlets aren't powered:

1. Verify Camp Mode is active (not just climate on)
2. Check outlets are enabled in settings
3. Try a different USB port
4. Reboot the system

### Entertainment System Issues

If screens or audio don't work in Camp Mode:

- Select Camp Mode specifically (not Dog Mode)
- Rear screen access may require enabling
- Audio should work through car speakers
- Check for software updates

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Camp Mode is designed for extended use. For best battery preservation, set climate to a moderate temperature and disable unnecessary features.
</div>

## Cabin Overheat Protection Problems

### Not Activating

Cabin Overheat Protection must be enabled:

1. Go to **Controls > Safety > Cabin Overheat Protection**
2. Choose **On** or **No A/C** (fan only)
3. Feature only activates when cabin exceeds 40°C (105°F)

### Battery Drain Concerns

Cabin Overheat Protection uses significant energy:

| Setting | Approximate Usage |
|---------|-------------------|
| A/C On | 1-2% per hour when active |
| Fan Only | 0.5% per hour when active |
| Off | No usage |

**Recommendations:**
- Use "Fan Only" if battery conservation is priority
- Disable when parked in shade
- Turn off for extended parking (more than a day)

### Not Working Properly

If cabin still gets extremely hot:

- Feature only runs for 12 hours maximum
- Won't activate below threshold temperature
- Check that AC system is functioning
- Verify feature is enabled in settings

## Temperature Setting Tips

### Recommended Temperatures

| Mode | Recommended Setting |
|------|---------------------|
| Dog Mode | 20-22°C (68-72°F) |
| Camp Mode | 20-24°C (68-75°F) |
| Overheat Protection | Default threshold |

### Battery Impact by Temperature

More extreme temperatures use more energy:

- **Mild temperatures** (21°C): Minimal impact
- **Cool settings** (18°C): Higher AC usage
- **Warm settings** (25°C): Minimal in summer

## Monitoring from Tesla App

Use the app to verify climate features:

1. Open Tesla app
2. Check **Climate** section
3. Verify mode is active
4. Monitor interior temperature
5. Check battery level

### Setting Up Notifications

Enable alerts for peace of mind:

- App notifies if Dog Mode deactivates
- Battery level warnings available
- Temperature alerts can be configured

## Common Error Messages

| Message | Meaning | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| "Climate unavailable" | System issue | Reboot, check battery |
| "Battery too low" | Under threshold | Charge before using |
| "Dog Mode off" | Triggered deactivation | Check what caused it |

## When to Contact Service

Reach out to Tesla if:

- Climate system doesn't cool/heat at all (see [AC troubleshooting](/posts/tesla-ac-not-cooling/) or [heat pump guide](/posts/tesla-heat-pump-problems/))
- Features enable but don't maintain temperature
- Error messages persist after reboots
- AC compressor makes unusual noises
