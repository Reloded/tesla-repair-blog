**Quick answer:** Format your USB drive to **exFAT** and create a folder named **TeslaCam**. That's it.

Here's how to do it on any device:

## Option 1: Let Tesla Format It (Easiest)

Your Tesla can format the drive for you:

1. Insert a blank USB drive into the glovebox port
2. Go to **Controls > Safety > Dashcam**
3. Tap **Format USB Drive**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes

Done. The car creates the TeslaCam folder automatically.

## Option 2: Format on Windows

1. Plug in your USB drive
2. Open File Explorer
3. Right-click the drive → **Format**
4. Set File System to **exFAT**
5. Click **Start**
6. After formatting, open the drive and create a new folder named exactly: **TeslaCam**

## Option 3: Format on Mac

1. Open **Disk Utility** (search in Spotlight)
2. Select your USB drive in the sidebar
3. Click **Erase**
4. Set Format to **exFAT**
5. Click **Erase**
6. Open the drive in Finder and create a folder named: **TeslaCam**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> The folder must be named exactly <strong>TeslaCam</strong> — capital T, capital C, no spaces. Otherwise Sentry Mode won't record.
</div>

## What USB Drive Should I Use?

For Tesla dashcam and Sentry Mode, you need:

- **128GB minimum** (256GB recommended for longer storage)
- **High-endurance rated** (regular drives fail from constant recording)
- **USB 3.0** or faster

Good options: Samsung Bar Plus, SanDisk High Endurance, Samsung T7 SSD.

Avoid cheap generic drives — they'll fail within months.

## Where to Plug It In

| Model | Best Port for Dashcam |
|-------|----------------------|
| Model 3/Y | Glovebox USB-A port |
| Model S/X | Center console or glovebox |

The glovebox port is specifically designed for always-on recording.

## Still Not Working?

If your drive isn't recognized after formatting:

1. Try a different USB port
2. Reboot the car (hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds)
3. Make sure Sentry Mode is enabled: **Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode**

*Takes 30 seconds to format, saves hours of troubleshooting. A properly formatted high-endurance drive is the key to reliable Sentry Mode recording.*
