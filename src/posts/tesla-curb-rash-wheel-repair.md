Curb rash is practically a rite of passage for Tesla owners. Those wide wheels with minimal tire sidewall—especially on Model 3 Performance and Model Y with Überturbines—are magnets for curb damage. The good news? Most curb rash is entirely fixable at home for $30-60, compared to $150-300+ at a wheel repair shop.

This guide walks you through assessing the damage, choosing the right approach, and getting your Tesla wheels looking like new again.

## Assess the Damage First

Not all curb rash is created equal. Before you buy supplies, take a close look at your wheel and figure out what you're dealing with. The severity determines your approach and whether DIY makes sense.

### Level 1: Light Scuff (Surface Scratches)

**What it looks like:** Faint marks on the wheel surface. You can feel a slight texture change when you run your finger over it, but there's no material missing. The clear coat may be scratched or removed in spots.

**DIY difficulty:** Easy
**Repair time:** 30-60 minutes
**What you need:** Fine sandpaper (400-800 grit), touch-up paint, clear coat

This is the most common type and the easiest to fix. Often happens from barely brushing a curb while parallel parking.

### Level 2: Moderate Gouge (Material Removed)

**What it looks like:** Visible scratches with material gouged out of the wheel surface. You can catch your fingernail in the grooves. The damaged area is rough and may have small chips or flaking.

**DIY difficulty:** Medium
**Repair time:** 2-3 hours (including drying time)
**What you need:** Coarser sandpaper (220-800 grit progression), spot putty/filler, primer, touch-up paint, clear coat

This is the classic curb rash from a solid scrape against a parking curb. Very fixable at home with patience.

### Level 3: Severe Damage (Deep Gouges or Structural)

**What it looks like:** Large chunks of material missing, deep gouges you can fit a fingernail into sideways, visible cracks, or the wheel lip is bent or deformed.

**DIY difficulty:** Hard / Not recommended
**Repair time:** Professional repair needed
**What you need:** A professional wheel repair service

If you can see cracks, bending, or the gouge is deeper than about 2mm, consider professional repair. Structural damage affects wheel integrity and safety. A cracked or bent wheel can cause vibration, air leaks, or worse—sudden failure at speed.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety First:</strong> If your wheel has any visible cracks, bends, or deformation, do NOT attempt a DIY repair. These affect structural integrity. Have the wheel professionally inspected. Cosmetic repair on a structurally compromised wheel is dangerous.
</div>

## Know Your Tesla Wheel Colors

Getting the right color match is critical. Here are the most common Tesla wheel types and their approximate color codes:

| Wheel | Size | Color Name |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Aero (Model 3) | 18" | Sonic Carbon Grey |
| Sport (Model 3) | 19" | Gunpowder Metallic Grey |
| Überturbine (Model 3/Y Performance) | 20"/21" | Gunpowder Metallic Grey |
| Induction (Model Y) | 20" | Armor Black |
| Gemini (Model Y) | 19" | Dark Grey |
| Apollo (Model 3 Highland) | 19" | Sonic Silver |
| Photon (Model 3 Highland) | 18" | Dark Grey |
| Twin Turbine (Model S) | 21" | Sonic Carbon Grey |
| Arachnid (Model S) | 21" | Silver Grey |
| Tempest (Model S) | 19" | Sonic Carbon Grey |

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Tesla-specific wheel touch-up paint pens are available from vendors like Tesland, T Sportline, and Abstract Ocean. These are pre-matched to Tesla wheel colors and far easier than trying to mix custom paint at an auto parts store. A Tesla-specific paint pen costs $15-25 and is worth every penny for color accuracy.
</div>

**Finding your exact color:** Check the Tesla service manual for your model year. Wheel colors occasionally change between production years. When in doubt, remove the aero cap (if applicable) and bring the wheel or a clear photo to an auto paint shop for matching.

## What You'll Need

Here's the complete supply list. For a **Level 1** repair, you can skip the filler/putty and coarser sandpaper.

**Sanding supplies:**
- 220-grit sandpaper (for shaping filler and initial smoothing of deep gouges)
- 400-grit sandpaper (for smoothing the repair area)
- 800-grit sandpaper (for final smoothing before paint)
- 1500-2000 grit (optional, for wet-sanding the final clear coat)

**Filler and primer (Level 2+ only):**
- Bondo Glazing & Spot Putty (or equivalent automotive spot filler)
- Self-etching primer spray (gray or color-matched)

**Paint and finish:**
- Color-matched wheel touch-up paint (pen or small can)
- Automotive clear coat spray
- Isopropyl alcohol (90%+ for cleaning)

**Masking and protection:**
- Automotive masking tape (3M blue tape works great)
- Plastic sheeting or newspaper
- Tire dressing or petroleum jelly (to protect the tire)
- Microfiber cloths

**Optional but helpful:**
- Plastic pry tools (for removing aero caps)
- Sanding block (keeps sandpaper flat and even)
- Rubber gloves
- Tack cloth (removes dust before painting)

**Total DIY cost:** $30-60 for supplies that will cover multiple wheels.

## Step-by-Step: Light Scuff Repair (Level 1)

For surface scratches with no material loss, this simpler process works perfectly.

### Step 1: Clean the Wheel Thoroughly

Wash the entire wheel with soap and water. Remove all brake dust, road grime, and tar. Then clean the damaged area with isopropyl alcohol on a microfiber cloth. The surface must be completely clean and dry before you start.

### Step 2: Light Sanding

Using 400-grit sandpaper, gently sand the scuffed area. The goal is to smooth any raised edges and remove loose clear coat. Sand in one direction, not in circles. You only need to sand the damaged area plus about 5mm around it.

Finish with 800-grit to create a smooth surface for paint adhesion.

Wipe clean with isopropyl alcohol again.

### Step 3: Apply Touch-Up Paint

Shake the touch-up paint pen thoroughly (at least 60 seconds). Apply thin, even coats to the sanded area. Two to three thin coats are much better than one thick coat.

Wait 10-15 minutes between coats. Let the final coat dry for at least 30 minutes before clear coating.

### Step 4: Apply Clear Coat

Mask off the area around the repair (about 15cm / 6 inches around it) to protect against overspray. Apply the tire with petroleum jelly or cover it with a plastic bag.

Apply 2-3 light coats of clear coat spray, holding the can 20-25cm from the wheel. Keep the coats thin and even. Wait 5-10 minutes between coats.

Let the final clear coat cure for at least 24 hours before washing or exposing to rain.

## Step-by-Step: Moderate Gouge Repair (Level 2)

This is the full repair process for when material is actually missing from the wheel surface.

### Step 1: Clean and Prep

Wash the wheel thoroughly with soap and water. Clean the damaged area with isopropyl alcohol. Remove any loose material, chips, or flaking paint with a plastic pry tool or your fingernail.

If you have aero caps, [remove them first](/posts/tesla-aero-cap-removal/) to access the full wheel surface.

### Step 2: Mask the Area

Use automotive masking tape to protect the tire sidewall and any undamaged wheel surface around the repair area. Leave about 2-3cm of clearance around the damage. Cover the tire with a plastic bag or newspaper if you'll be spraying primer or paint.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the tire sidewall near the damaged area. Even if paint overspray lands on it, it wipes right off.
</div>

### Step 3: Initial Sanding (220 Grit)

Start with 220-grit sandpaper on a sanding block. Sand the damaged area to remove any sharp edges, raised material, and remaining clear coat. The goal is to create a smooth, even surface for the filler.

Sand about 1cm beyond the visible damage to feather the edges—this helps the repair blend seamlessly.

Wipe the area clean with isopropyl alcohol and a tack cloth.

### Step 4: Apply Filler/Putty

Squeeze a small amount of Bondo Glazing & Spot Putty onto a clean surface (a piece of cardboard works). Using a plastic spreader or an old credit card, apply the putty into the gouge.

**Key technique:** Apply slightly more filler than needed. It's much easier to sand excess filler down than to add more later. Push the filler firmly into the gouge to eliminate air bubbles.

Smooth the surface as much as possible with the spreader. The closer you get it now, the less sanding later.

Let the filler cure completely according to the product instructions—usually 15-30 minutes. It should be hard to the touch and not tacky at all.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Don't rush:</strong> If you sand the filler before it's fully cured, it will gum up the sandpaper and create an uneven surface. Wait the full cure time.
</div>

### Step 5: Shape and Smooth the Filler

This is where patience pays off. You'll work through progressively finer grits:

**220 grit:** Shape the filler down to match the wheel contour. Use a sanding block to keep the surface flat. Check your progress frequently by running your finger across the repair—it should feel flush with the surrounding wheel surface.

**400 grit:** Switch to 400-grit to refine the surface. Remove the scratches left by the 220-grit. The surface should start feeling smooth.

**800 grit:** Final smoothing pass. The repaired area should now feel as smooth as the surrounding wheel. If you can still feel a transition between the filler and the original wheel surface, go back to 400 and blend more.

Wipe clean with isopropyl alcohol after each grit change.

### Step 6: Apply Primer

If you used filler, a coat of self-etching primer helps the paint adhere properly. Apply 1-2 light coats of primer to the repaired area. Hold the spray can 20-25cm away and use smooth, even passes.

Let the primer dry for 15-20 minutes between coats, and at least 30 minutes before painting.

Once dry, lightly scuff the primer with 800-grit sandpaper. This gives the paint something to grip. Wipe clean.

### Step 7: Apply Color-Matched Paint

This is the moment of truth. Apply your Tesla color-matched paint in thin, even coats:

1. **First coat:** Very light. It won't fully cover—that's fine
2. **Wait 10-15 minutes**
3. **Second coat:** Slightly heavier, building coverage
4. **Wait 10-15 minutes**
5. **Third coat:** Final coverage coat if needed

For paint pens, use short, overlapping strokes. For spray paint, use smooth side-to-side passes, starting and ending the spray off the wheel.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Paint in a shaded area away from direct sunlight. Ideal temperature is 15-25°C (60-77°F). Too cold and the paint won't adhere; too hot and it dries before leveling properly. Avoid painting in wind or high humidity.
</div>

### Step 8: Apply Clear Coat

Wait at least 30 minutes after the final paint coat. Then apply 2-3 coats of automotive clear coat:

1. Light first coat—just a mist
2. Wait 10 minutes
3. Medium second coat
4. Wait 10 minutes
5. Final coat for gloss and protection

The clear coat protects the paint from UV, brake dust, and road chemicals. Don't skip it.

### Step 9: Cure and Finish

Remove the masking tape carefully while the clear coat is still slightly tacky (about 30 minutes after the final coat). This prevents the tape from peeling up the clear coat edges.

Let the repair cure for **at least 24 hours** before washing or driving in rain. Full cure takes about 7 days—avoid car washes and harsh chemicals during this period.

**Optional final step:** After 48 hours, you can wet-sand the clear coat with 1500-2000 grit sandpaper, then polish with a rubbing compound for a truly seamless finish.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Skipping grits in the sanding progression**
Jumping from 220 to 800 leaves deep scratches that show through the paint. Work through each grit patiently.

**2. Applying paint too thick**
Thick coats drip, sag, and take forever to dry. Three thin coats always look better than one heavy coat.

**3. Not masking properly**
Overspray on the tire or surrounding wheel is hard to remove. Spend the extra 5 minutes masking.

**4. Painting in bad conditions**
Direct sunlight, extreme cold, wind, and rain all ruin paint jobs. Pick a calm, shaded day with moderate temperatures.

**5. Not cleaning with alcohol before painting**
Oils from your fingers, silicone from tire dressing, and brake dust contamination will prevent paint from bonding. Clean, then clean again.

**6. Touching the repair too soon**
The surface may feel dry in 30 minutes, but the paint needs 24+ hours to fully harden. One accidental scuff and you're starting over.

**7. Wrong paint color**
"Close enough" is very visible on a wheel. Invest in Tesla-specific color-matched paint rather than guessing at the auto parts store.

## DIY vs Professional Repair: When to Call a Pro

| Factor | DIY | Professional |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Cost** | $30-60 | $150-300+ per wheel |
| **Time** | 2-4 hours | Drop off for a day |
| **Finish quality** | Good (80-90% match) | Excellent (95-100%) |
| **Deep gouges** | Requires patience | Handled easily |
| **Structural damage** | Cannot fix | Can assess and repair |
| **Machine-finished wheels** | Difficult to match | CNC lathe refinish |

**Go professional if:**
- The wheel has cracks or bends
- The damage covers more than 25% of the wheel lip
- Your wheel has a machine-finished (diamond-cut) face—these have a lathe pattern that can't be replicated by hand
- You want a perfect, showroom finish
- The wheel is severely corroded under the damage

**DIY makes sense if:**
- The damage is cosmetic only (no structural issues)
- You're dealing with 1-3 small to medium gouges
- The wheel has a painted (not machine-cut) finish
- You're comfortable with a "very good" result that's invisible at 3 feet
- You want to save $100-250 per wheel

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Model-specific note:</strong> The Überturbine wheels on Model 3/Y Performance and the Induction wheels on Model Y are painted finishes—great candidates for DIY repair. The 18" Aero wheels are also painted and very forgiving. Sport wheels and some Model S wheels have machine-finished faces that are much harder to DIY match.
</div>

## Preventing Future Curb Rash

Once you've fixed your wheels, you'll want to keep them that way:

- **Rim protectors/guards:** Adhesive strips that fit on the wheel lip. They take the hit instead of your wheel. Available in matching colors for most Tesla wheels ($20-40 for a set of 4)
- **Ceramic coating:** Apply a wheel-specific ceramic coating after repair. It adds a protective layer and makes cleaning easier
- **Camera awareness:** Use the Tesla side cameras when parallel parking. The top-down view is incredibly helpful
- **Curb awareness:** The wide Tesla wheels extend further than you think. Give curbs an extra 10cm of clearance
- **Parking sensors:** Trust them. If the car is beeping, stop

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I repair curb rash on my Tesla at home?

Yes, most cosmetic curb rash is very fixable at home. Light scuffs take about 30 minutes, moderate gouges about 2-3 hours including drying time. You'll need sandpaper, filler (for deeper damage), color-matched paint, and clear coat—about $30-60 total.

### What color paint do I need for Tesla wheels?

It depends on your wheel type. Most common: Aero wheels use Sonic Carbon Grey, Überturbines use Gunpowder Metallic Grey, Induction wheels use Armor Black, and Gemini wheels use Dark Grey. Tesla-specific paint pens from vendors like Tesland or T Sportline are pre-matched and recommended.

### Does Tesla warranty cover curb rash?

No. Curb rash is considered cosmetic damage from use and is not covered by Tesla's warranty. You can pay Tesla Service to repair or replace wheels, but it's typically $300-500+ per wheel for OEM replacement.

### How much does professional curb rash repair cost?

Mobile wheel repair services typically charge $150-200 per wheel for standard curb rash. Severe damage or specialty finishes can run $250-400+. Full wheel replacement from Tesla ranges from $300-700+ depending on the wheel type.

### Will curb rash cause tire problems?

Minor cosmetic curb rash on the wheel lip won't affect tire performance. However, if the damage extends to the bead seat (where the tire seals against the wheel), it can cause slow air leaks. If you notice tire pressure dropping after curbing, have it inspected.

### Can I use regular spray paint from a hardware store?

You can, but the color match will likely be poor. Generic silver or black spray paint rarely matches Tesla's specific wheel colors. For $15-25 more, Tesla-specific paint pens provide a dramatically better result that's worth the investment.

### How long does a DIY curb rash repair last?

A properly done repair with primer, color-matched paint, and clear coat should last 2-5 years under normal driving conditions. Using automotive-grade products (not craft paint) and applying proper clear coat are the key factors for durability.

### Should I remove the wheel for repair?

For minor repairs (Level 1-2), you don't need to remove the wheel. Just turn the steering wheel to expose the damaged area, or jack up the car and rotate the wheel for better access. Only remove the wheel if the damage is on a hard-to-reach area or you're doing a full refinish.

---

**Bottom line:** Don't stress about curb rash. It happens to nearly every Tesla owner eventually—those wide, low-profile tires and flush wheel designs practically invite it. For most damage, a weekend afternoon and $30-60 in supplies will have your wheels looking great again. Save the $150-300 shop fee for something more fun.
