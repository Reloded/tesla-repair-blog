The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y glove box is opened via the touchscreen — there's no physical button. When the latch mechanism fails, you're locked out of your glove box or it won't stay closed. This is one of the most common and annoying interior issues, but fortunately it's also one of the easiest and cheapest to fix.

## Symptoms

- **Glove box won't open** when you tap the button on the touchscreen
- **Glove box pops open** on its own while driving (over bumps)
- **Clicking sound** from the latch but glove box doesn't release
- **Glove box hangs open** and won't stay latched
- **No response** from the touchscreen glove box button

## Quick Fixes Before Replacing Anything

### Fix 1: Reboot the Touchscreen

If the button on the touchscreen doesn't respond at all:
1. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. Wait for the screen to restart
3. Try opening the glove box again

This fixes software glitches that occasionally prevent the glove box signal from reaching the latch.

### Fix 2: Manual Emergency Release

If you need to get into a stuck glove box:

1. Look under the dashboard, to the right of the glove box opening
2. There may be a small emergency release lever or cable
3. On some Model 3/Y, you can gently pry the top edge of the glove box door with a trim tool while tapping the open button on screen
4. **Don't force it** — the latch mechanism is plastic and breaks easily

### Fix 3: Check the USB Hub

On 2021+ Model 3/Y, the USB hub is inside the glove box. If the USB hub has a fault, it can sometimes affect the glove box latch circuit. Check if your [USB ports are working](/posts/tesla-usb-not-working/).

## The Common Failure: Latch Clip

The most common failure is a small plastic clip inside the latch mechanism that breaks or wears out. It's a $5–15 part, but Tesla will charge you significantly more for the service visit.

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 15–30 minutes
**Skill Level:** Beginner — no special tools required for most fixes

**Parts:**

- **Glove box latch assembly** (~$15–40) — available from Tesla parts suppliers and Amazon
- **Latch clip only** (~$5–10) — if you can find just the clip, it's all you need

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $50–100 | $100–200 | $150–300 |
| Independent Shop | $30–60 | $50–100 | $80–160 |
| DIY | $15–40 | Your time | $15–40 |

**Your savings: $65–260**

## Step-by-Step Latch Replacement

### Step 1: Open the Glove Box

If the glove box is stuck closed:
1. Use the emergency release method described above
2. Or: gently press inward on the glove box door while tapping the touchscreen open button

If the glove box won't stay closed (the more common scenario), just open it normally.

### Step 2: Remove the Glove Box Door

1. Open the glove box fully
2. On Model 3/Y, the glove box door has a damper arm on the right side — unhook it by sliding the clip
3. The door is held by two hinge pins at the bottom — push them inward or slide to release
4. Lift the door out

### Step 3: Access the Latch Mechanism

1. The latch is located at the top center of the glove box opening
2. It's a small plastic assembly with an electric solenoid
3. Disconnect the electrical connector (small 2-pin connector)
4. The latch is usually held by 1–2 screws or clips

### Step 4: Replace the Latch

1. Remove the old latch assembly
2. Compare with the new one — confirm it's identical
3. Install the new latch in the same position
4. Reconnect the electrical connector
5. Test before reassembling — tap the glove box button on the touchscreen and confirm the latch clicks

### Step 5: Reinstall the Glove Box Door

1. Align the hinge pins at the bottom of the door opening
2. Push the door into position until the hinges click
3. Reattach the damper arm
4. Close the glove box and test several times:
   - Opens when tapped on screen ✅
   - Stays closed while driving ✅
   - Closes smoothly without force ✅

## Glove Box Won't Open at All (Solenoid Failure)

If the latch clip is fine but the glove box still won't open, the electric solenoid inside the latch may have failed:

1. You'll hear no click at all when pressing the touchscreen button
2. Use a multimeter to check for 12V at the latch connector when the button is pressed
3. If voltage is present but no click → solenoid is dead → replace the entire latch assembly
4. If no voltage → the issue is upstream (wiring, touchscreen MCU, or fuse)

<strong>Fuse Check:</strong> The glove box latch shares a fuse circuit with other interior accessories. If multiple interior features are dead, check the fuse panel under the rear seat.
