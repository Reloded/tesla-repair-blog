While Tesla brake rotors can last 100,000+ miles thanks to regenerative braking, they do eventually wear out. Warped or grooved rotors cause vibration, noise, and reduced stopping power. Here's how to replace them yourself and save $200-400+ in labor costs.

## When Do Tesla Rotors Need Replacement?

Unlike brake pads, rotors don't have a set replacement interval. Replace them when you notice:

- **Vibration or pulsing** through the brake pedal when stopping
- **Grooves or scoring** visible on the rotor surface
- **Thickness below minimum spec** (measured with a caliper)
- **Cracks** in the rotor surface
- **Glazed or blue spots** from overheating
- **Uneven wear patterns**

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Vibration = Warped Rotors:</strong> If you feel pulsing through the brake pedal during normal stops, the rotors have likely warped. This often happens from heavy braking while hot (like driving down a mountain), then sitting at a light.
</div>

## Rotor Specifications by Model

Tesla uses different brake sizes depending on model and whether you have performance brakes.

### Model 3/Y Standard Brakes

| Position | Diameter | Minimum Thickness |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Front    | 320mm    | 26mm              |
| Rear     | 320mm    | 18mm              |

### Model 3 Performance / Model Y Performance

| Position | Diameter | Minimum Thickness |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Front    | 355mm    | 32mm              |
| Rear     | 335mm    | 22mm              |

### Model S/X (2021+)

| Position | Diameter | Minimum Thickness |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Front    | 355mm    | 32mm              |
| Rear     | 365mm    | 24mm              |

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>How to Measure:</strong> Use a digital caliper to measure rotor thickness at multiple points. If any measurement is below minimum spec, replace the rotor.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours (all four corners)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate

**Replacement Rotors:**

- **OEM Tesla rotors** (~$100-150 each)
- **Brembo rotors** (~$80-120 each) - OEM supplier
- **Power Stop drilled/slotted** (~$70-100 each) - Popular upgrade
- **DBA rotors** (~$90-130 each) - Quality aftermarket

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Always replace rotors in pairs (both fronts or both rears). Mismatched rotors cause uneven braking.
</div>

## Step-by-Step Rotor Replacement

### Preparation

1. Park on a level surface
2. Engage Jack Mode: **Controls > Service > Jack Mode**
3. Gather all tools and verify new rotor sizes match your car
4. Have brake cleaner ready—new rotors have protective oil coating

### Lifting the Vehicle

1. Locate your Tesla's [jack points](/posts/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/)
2. Use a Tesla-specific jack pad to protect the battery
3. Lift and secure on jack stands
4. Remove the wheel (21mm lug nuts)

### Removing the Caliper and Bracket

Unlike a [brake pad replacement](/posts/tesla-brake-pad-replacement/) where you only swing the caliper up, rotor replacement requires removing the entire caliper bracket.

**Front Rotors:**

1. Remove both caliper mounting bolts (typically 21mm) from the bracket
2. Carefully lift the entire caliper assembly off
3. **Support the caliper** with a wire or bungee cord—never let it hang by the brake hose
4. Remove the two caliper bracket bolts from the knuckle (18mm)

**Rear Rotors:**

The rear brakes have an electronic parking brake that must be disengaged first:

1. Enable **EPB Service Mode** on the touchscreen:
   - Navigate to **Service Mode > Chassis > Brakes > EPB Service Mode**
   - Select "Both" for EPB Selection
   - Select "Start" for Action Selection
   - Tap **Run** and wait for completion
2. Now remove the caliper and bracket as described above
3. When finished, exit EPB Service Mode (same menu, select "Stop")

### Removing the Old Rotor

1. Remove the rotor retention screw (T30 Torx on most models)
   - This small screw holds the rotor on during assembly—braking force isn't applied through it
2. The rotor should slide off the hub
3. If stuck, apply penetrating oil and use a rubber mallet to break it loose
   - **Never hit the rotor surface**—strike the hub area from behind

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Stuck Rotor Tip:</strong> Thread two bolts into the small threaded holes on the rotor face. Tightening them evenly pushes the rotor off the hub.
</div>

### Preparing the New Rotor

1. **Clean the new rotor** thoroughly with brake cleaner
   - New rotors come with a protective oil coating that must be removed
   - Spray both sides and wipe until the rag comes away clean
2. Clean the hub surface with a wire brush
3. Apply a thin layer of **anti-seize** to the hub mounting surface
   - This prevents future rotor seizure
   - **Keep anti-seize off the rotor friction surface**

### Installing the New Rotor

1. Slide the new rotor onto the hub
2. Install the rotor retention screw (T30 Torx)
   - Don't overtighten—just snug
3. Reinstall the caliper bracket
   - **Use new caliper bracket bolts** (Tesla recommends not reusing)
   - Torque to **175 Nm (129 ft-lbs)**
4. Reinstall the caliper
   - Torque caliper guide pin bolts to **33 Nm (24 ft-lbs)**
5. Mark bolts with paint pen after torquing (standard Tesla practice)

### Brake Pad Note

While you have the caliper off, inspect your brake pads. If they're worn (less than 4mm), now is the ideal time to replace them—see our [brake pad replacement guide](/posts/tesla-brake-pad-replacement/).

### Reinstall the Wheel

1. Hand-tighten lug nuts in a star pattern
2. Lower vehicle off jack stands
3. Torque lug nuts to **175 Nm (129 ft-lbs)** in a star pattern
4. Repeat for other wheels

## Bed-In Procedure for New Rotors

**This step is critical.** Proper bed-in transfers an even layer of pad material onto the new rotor surface, ensuring consistent braking and preventing vibration.

### Standard Bed-In (Street Pads)

1. Find a safe, straight road with no traffic
2. From **35 mph**, apply moderate braking (60-70% pedal) down to 5 mph
   - **Don't come to a complete stop**—keeps heat distribution even
3. Accelerate back to 35 mph, repeat **8-10 times**
4. From **45 mph**, apply firm braking (80% pedal) down to 5 mph
5. Repeat **5 times** with 30-second intervals
6. Drive 5-10 minutes normally to cool the brakes
7. **Avoid heavy braking for the first 100 miles**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Do Not:</strong> Come to a complete stop during bed-in. This imprints pad material unevenly and causes the vibration you're trying to avoid.
</div>

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Front Pair | Rear Pair | Labor |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $300-500 | $300-500 | $200-400 |
| Independent Shop | $200-350 | $200-350 | $150-300 |
| DIY (Quality Rotors) | $150-250 | $150-250 | Your time |

**Potential savings: $300-700+** by doing it yourself

## Common Questions

**Can I resurface (machine) Tesla rotors instead of replacing?**
Sometimes. If the rotor is above minimum thickness after machining, it's acceptable. However, machining costs $30-50 per rotor—often not worth it compared to new rotors.

**Should I replace rotors and pads together?**
If pads are worn below 4mm, yes. Fresh rotors with worn pads will wear unevenly. If pads are good, you can reuse them.

**Why are my new rotors rusting?**
This is normal. New rotors develop surface rust within hours of installation. It wears off after a few brake applications.

**Drilled vs. slotted vs. blank rotors?**
- **Blank (OEM-style):** Quietest, longest-lasting, best for daily driving
- **Slotted:** Better heat dissipation, slightly shorter life
- **Drilled:** Looks cool, worst durability—can crack over time

For most Tesla owners, blank or slotted rotors are the best choice.

**How long should new rotors last?**
With Tesla's regenerative braking, expect 75,000-150,000 miles depending on driving style.

## Torque Specifications

| Component | Torque |
|-----------|--------|
| Wheel lug nuts | 175 Nm (129 ft-lbs) |
| Caliper bracket bolts | 175 Nm (129 ft-lbs) |
| Caliper guide pin bolts | 33 Nm (24 ft-lbs) |
| Rotor retention screw | Snug (not torqued) |

*Rotor replacement is a satisfying DIY job that saves significant money. It's also a good time to [flush your brake fluid](/posts/tesla-brake-fluid-change/) while you're servicing the brakes. Combined with the long lifespan of Tesla brakes, you might only do this once or twice over your ownership.*
