The optional air suspension system on Tesla Model S and Model X provides adjustable ride height and a smooth driving experience. When problems occur, repairs can be expensive at the service center. This guide helps you diagnose issues and understand what you can fix yourself.

## Symptoms of Air Suspension Problems

Common signs your air suspension needs attention:

- **Car sits low** on one or more corners
- **"Suspension needs service"** warning message
- **Compressor runs constantly** (you can hear it)
- **Uneven ride height** between sides
- **Suspension won't raise** to higher settings
- **Slow height adjustment** when loading/unloading

## Understanding the System

Tesla's air suspension consists of:

1. **Air compressor** - Creates pressure for the system
2. **Air springs** (4) - One at each corner
3. **Valve block** - Controls air distribution
4. **Height sensors** - Measure vehicle position
5. **Air lines** - Connect all components

## Diagnosing the Problem

### Step 1: Check for Leaks

Air leaks are the most common issue.

1. Park on a level surface
2. Listen for hissing sounds around each wheel
3. Mix soap and water in a spray bottle
4. Spray connections at each air spring
5. Bubbles indicate a leak location

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Leaks often occur at the air line fittings rather than the air springs themselves. These are much cheaper to repair.
</div>

### Step 2: Compressor Test

If the car sits low everywhere:

1. Turn off the car and wait 5 minutes
2. Turn the car on without driving
3. Listen for the compressor near the front
4. If silent, the compressor may have failed
5. A clicking sound indicates a relay issue

### Step 3: Check Error Codes

Use a Tesla-compatible diagnostic tool:

- **APP_w221** - Air spring leak detected
- **APP_w222** - Compressor overheating
- **APP_w223** - Height sensor fault
- **APP_w224** - Valve block malfunction

## DIY Fixes You Can Perform

### Ride Height Calibration

After any suspension work:

1. Park on a flat, level surface
2. Go to **Controls > Suspension > Calibrate Ride Height**
3. Exit the vehicle and close all doors
4. Wait for calibration to complete (5-10 minutes)
5. The car will adjust itself and confirm completion

### Air Line Replacement

If you've found a leaking connection:

1. **Safely lift** the vehicle on jack stands
2. Locate the leaking air line
3. Release pressure by lowering suspension to lowest setting
4. Disconnect the old fitting
5. Install new air line with proper fittings
6. Raise suspension and check for leaks

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Always use proper jack stands. Never work under a car supported only by a jack. The air suspension can unexpectedly lower.
</div>

### Compressor Relay Replacement

A clicking compressor often means a failed relay:

1. Locate the relay box (front trunk area)
2. Identify the air suspension relay
3. Replace with an identical relay
4. Test by raising the suspension
5. This fix costs under $30

## Repair Cost Comparison

| Component | Tesla Service | DIY Cost |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Air Spring (each) | $800-1200 | $300-500 |
| Compressor | $1500-2000 | $400-700 |
| Air Lines | $500-800 | $50-150 |
| Valve Block | $1200-1800 | $400-800 |

## Preventive Maintenance

Extend your air suspension life:

- **Don't overload** the vehicle beyond capacity
- **Avoid deep water** that can damage components
- **Listen for changes** in compressor behavior
- **Check ride height** periodically when parked

## When Professional Help is Needed

Seek Tesla service for:

- Air spring replacement (special tools required)
- Valve block replacement (coding needed)
- Height sensor recalibration
- Compressor replacement (requires proper bleeding)

While some owners have successfully replaced air springs themselves, the job requires removing wheels, releasing tension, and proper installation to avoid damage.
