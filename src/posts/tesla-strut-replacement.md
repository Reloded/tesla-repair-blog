description: "Replace weak or failed lift struts on your Tesla frunk or trunk. Easy 10-minute DIY with no tools required. Covers Model 3, Y, S, and X."

difficulty: "Very Easy"
time: "10-15 minutes"
cost: "$25-60"
faq:
  - q: "How do I know if my struts need replacement?"
    a: "Signs include: hood/trunk won't stay open on its own, opens very slowly, makes hissing sounds, or you see oil leaking from the strut cylinder. Struts typically last 5-7 years or 100k+ miles."
  - q: "Can I upgrade to automatic-opening struts?"
    a: "Yes! Aftermarket struts with higher gas pressure can make your frunk open fully by itself instead of just popping up a few inches. Popular upgrade for Model 3 and Model Y."
  - q: "Do I need any tools?"
    a: "Just a plastic trim tool (or flat screwdriver wrapped in tape) to pop the clips. No wrenches, no bolts. Tesla designed these for easy DIY replacement."
  - q: "Should I replace both struts at once?"
    a: "Yes. If one has failed, the other is likely close behind. Replacing both ensures even lifting force and prevents the hood/trunk from opening crooked."
  - q: "Can I replace struts on a powered trunk?"
    a: "No. Model 3 vehicles made after January 2024 and some Model S/X have powered trunks with electric motors. These require Tesla service—the struts aren't user-replaceable."

Is your Tesla frunk barely popping open? Trunk slowly sinking closed? The lift struts (gas springs) are worn out—and they're one of the easiest DIY repairs you can do.

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Tools:** Plastic trim tool only  
**Cost:** $25-60 for a pair of struts

This guide covers frunk (front hood) and trunk strut replacement for Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X.

## Before You Start

### Check If Your Struts Are User-Replaceable

**Not replaceable by owner:**
- Model 3 manufactured after ~January 2024 (powered trunk)
- Model S/X with soft-close or power trunk features
- Any trunk with an electric motor assist

**Replaceable by owner:**
- Model 3 manufactured before ~January 2024 (non-powered)
- Model Y (most versions)
- Model S/X frunk struts (hood)
- Model S/X non-powered trunk struts

If you're unsure, look at your trunk hinges. If you see an electric motor connected to the strut or hinge, it's powered—don't attempt DIY replacement.

### Get the Right Parts

**Model 3 Frunk (Hood) Struts:**
- OEM replacement or aftermarket (ARANA, AY Customs, Abstract Ocean)
- Upgraded "auto-lift" struts available (opens frunk fully by itself)
- Approx. $30-50 per pair

**Model 3 Trunk Struts (Pre-2024 Non-Powered):**
- OEM or aftermarket
- Approx. $25-40 per pair

**Model Y Liftgate Struts:**
- Similar to Model 3 trunk
- Check for powered vs. non-powered before ordering

## Frunk (Hood) Strut Replacement

### Step 1: Support the Hood

1. Open the frunk fully
2. Use a non-marring prop (broom handle, foam pool noodle, etc.) to support the hood
3. Position the prop near the center of the hood for stability

**⚠️ Important:** Replace struts one at a time. Never remove both simultaneously—if your prop fails, the hood could drop on you.

### Step 2: Remove the Old Strut

Each strut has two ball-socket connections—one on the body, one on the hood.

1. **Release the bottom clip first** (body side):
   - Look for a small clip or ring on the ball socket
   - Insert your trim tool and pry the clip open
   - Pull the strut straight off the ball stud

2. **Release the top clip** (hood side):
   - Same process—pry the clip, pull off the ball stud
   - Remove the old strut from the vehicle

### Step 3: Install the New Strut

1. **Identify the correct orientation:**
   - The rod end (thinner part) typically goes on the body
   - The cylinder end (thicker part) goes on the hood
   - Check your other strut if unsure

2. **Lubricate the pivot points:**
   - Apply a small amount of silicone grease or white lithium grease to both ball studs
   - This ensures smooth operation and longevity

3. **Attach the body end first:**
   - Push the strut socket onto the ball stud until it clicks
   - Make sure the clip is fully engaged

4. **Attach the hood end:**
   - Push onto the ball stud until it clicks
   - Verify both ends are secure

### Step 4: Test and Repeat

1. Remove the prop
2. Close the frunk and reopen it
3. It should lift smoothly and stay open on its own
4. Repeat the process for the second strut

## Trunk Strut Replacement (Non-Powered Only)

The trunk procedure is nearly identical to the frunk.

### Step 1: Support the Trunk Lid

1. Open the trunk fully
2. Prop it open with a non-marring support
3. Work on one strut at a time

### Step 2: Remove the Old Strut

1. **Release the lower clip** (hinge/body side):
   - Insert trim tool under the clip
   - Pry to release, pull strut off the ball stud

2. **Release the upper clip** (trunk lid side):
   - Same process
   - Remove old strut

### Step 3: Install the New Strut

1. Clean the ball stud mounts (remove any old grease or debris)
2. Apply fresh lubricant to both pivot points
3. Attach the rod end to the body/hinge first
4. Attach the cylinder end to the trunk lid
5. Ensure both clips are fully seated

### Step 4: Test

1. Remove the prop
2. Close and reopen the trunk
3. Should lift smoothly and hold position
4. Repeat for the second strut

## Upgrading to Auto-Lift Struts

Want your frunk to open fully by itself instead of just popping up an inch? Upgraded struts with higher gas pressure can do this.

### Popular Options:

**Model 3 Frunk:**
- [Abstract Ocean Strut Upgrades](https://abstractocean.com/)
- [ARANA Automatic Frunk Lift](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ARANA+tesla+frunk+struts&tag=diyrepair07-20)
- [AY Customs Pneumatic Struts](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=AY+customs+tesla+frunk&tag=diyrepair07-20)

**How they work:**
- Standard struts provide ~50-60N of force (enough to hold open, not enough to lift)
- Upgraded struts provide ~80-100N (strong enough to push the hood fully open)

**Installation:** Identical to standard replacement—just swap in the upgraded struts.

**Caution:** Don't over-spec the force. Struts that are too strong can:
- Dent the underside of the hood
- Cause the hood to fly open aggressively
- Put stress on the hinges

Stick with reputable brands that are designed specifically for your Tesla model.

## Troubleshooting

**Strut won't clip onto ball stud:**
- Make sure you're pushing straight on, not at an angle
- Check that the clip isn't bent or damaged
- Verify you have the correct strut for your model

**Hood/trunk still won't stay open:**
- Did you replace both struts? One weak strut can drag down a new one
- Check that clips are fully engaged (you should hear/feel a click)
- Aftermarket struts occasionally have lower pressure—consider a different brand

**Hood opens crooked:**
- Both struts should be the same spec
- Check that both are properly clipped on both ends
- Verify the hinge isn't bent or damaged

**New struts feel too strong:**
- Give them a week to break in—new struts are often stiffer initially
- If still too aggressive, you may have installed upgraded struts when you wanted standard

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Time |
|--------|------|------|
| Tesla Service | $150-250 | Appointment wait |
| Independent Shop | $80-120 | 30 minutes |
| DIY | $25-60 | 10-15 minutes |

**Your savings: $100-200** for 10 minutes of easy work.
