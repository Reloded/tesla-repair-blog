Noticing your Tesla losing range overnight or not achieving the advertised range? This guide covers the common causes of range loss and practical fixes to maximize your battery's potential.

## Types of Range Loss

Understanding the difference helps identify solutions:

### Vampire Drain (Temporary)
- Range drops while car is parked
- Caused by features running in the background
- Fully recoverable with settings changes

### Battery Degradation (Permanent)
- Gradual capacity loss over time
- Normal with lithium-ion batteries
- Typically 10-15% over 200,000 miles

## Identifying Vampire Drain

Vampire drain is energy consumption while parked. Check your consumption:

1. Note your range before parking
2. Leave the car overnight
3. Check range in the morning
4. Normal: 1-3 miles lost
5. Excessive: 10+ miles lost

## Common Vampire Drain Sources

### Sentry Mode

The biggest drain source. Sentry Mode uses cameras constantly:

- **Typical drain:** 1-2 miles per hour
- **24 hours:** 24-48 miles lost
- **Weekly impact:** 168-336 miles

**Solutions:**
- Disable Sentry Mode at home
- Use location-based settings to auto-disable
- Enable only in high-risk areas

### Third-Party Apps

Apps like TeslaFi, Tessie, and Stats constantly wake the car:

| App Behavior | Daily Drain |
|--------------|-------------|
| Sleep-friendly apps | 1-3 miles |
| Aggressive polling | 10-20 miles |
| Constant connection | 20-40 miles |

**Solutions:**
- Configure apps to allow sleep mode
- Increase polling intervals
- Consider which features you actually need

### Cabin Overheat Protection

Keeps cabin below a set temperature:

- Uses AC compressor when hot
- Can drain 5-10 miles per activation
- Runs for up to 12 hours after parking

**Solutions:**
- Set to "Fan Only" instead of AC
- Disable if parked in shade
- Turn off in moderate weather

### Summon Standby

Keeps car ready for Summon commands:

- Requires constant system awareness
- Drains 2-3 miles per hour
- Often left on unintentionally

**Solution:** Disable in Controls > Autopilot > Summon Standby

## Optimizing Settings for Minimum Drain

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Optimal Settings for Minimum Vampire Drain:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sentry Mode: Off (at home)</li>
<li>Cabin Overheat: Fan Only or Off</li>
<li>Summon Standby: Off</li>
<li>Third-party apps: Sleep mode enabled</li>
<li>Smart Preconditioning: Off (unless needed)</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Real-World Range Factors

Your displayed range assumes ideal conditions. Real range varies by:

### Weather Impact
- **Cold weather:** 20-40% range reduction
- **Hot weather:** 10-15% for AC usage
- **Heat pump models:** Better cold weather efficiency

### Driving Style
- Highway speeds above 70 mph significantly reduce range
- Aggressive acceleration uses more energy
- [Regenerative braking](/posts/tesla-regen-braking-reduced/) improves efficiency

### Tire Pressure
- Under-inflated tires increase rolling resistance
- Check pressure monthly during [tire rotations](/posts/tesla-tire-rotation/)
- Use Tesla's recommended PSI (found on door jamb)

## Battery Health Best Practices

Preserve long-term battery capacity:

### Charging Habits

1. **Daily charging:** Set limit to 80%
2. **Road trips:** Charge to 100% only when needed
3. **Don't let it sit at 100%** for extended periods
4. **Avoid frequent deep discharges** below 10%

### Temperature Management

- **Precondition while plugged in** in cold weather
- **Park in shade** in hot weather
- **Avoid Supercharging** a hot battery

### Storage Tips

If leaving car unused for weeks:

- Set charge limit to 50-60%
- Disable Sentry Mode
- Turn off all background features
- Check battery weekly via app

## Checking Battery Degradation

Monitor your battery health:

1. **Charge to 100%** (occasionally)
2. **Note the displayed range**
3. **Compare to original specs**
4. **Track over time**

Typical degradation curve:
- **Year 1:** 5% loss (fastest decline)
- **Years 2-5:** 1-2% per year
- **Years 5+:** Minimal additional loss

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Range displayed is an estimate. Actual capacity is what matters. Some display range loss is software calibration, not real degradation.
</div>

## When to Contact Tesla

Seek service if:

- Range loss exceeds 30% of original
- Sudden range drop after being stable
- "Battery needs service" warnings appear
- Charging behavior changes dramatically

*Most range loss is due to settings and habits, not battery problems. Optimize your configuration and you'll likely recover significant range.*
