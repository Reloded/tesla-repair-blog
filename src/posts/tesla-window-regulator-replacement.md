difficulty: "Medium"
time: "2-3 hours"
cost: "$80-150"
faq:
  - q: "Can I drive with a broken window regulator?"
    a: "Yes, but it's not recommended. If the window is stuck down, your car is exposed to weather and theft. If stuck up, it's fine to drive but you can't use drive-throughs or toll booths easily."
  - q: "How long do Tesla window regulators last?"
    a: "Most last 100,000+ miles, but early Model 3 and Model S vehicles (2017-2020) had higher failure rates. Symptoms usually appear gradually—slow operation or grinding noises before complete failure."
  - q: "Are aftermarket regulators as good as OEM?"
    a: "Quality aftermarket options like Dorman work well for most owners and cost 30-50% less than Tesla OEM parts. For warranty coverage or if you're particular, stick with OEM."
  - q: "Does this repair void my warranty?"
    a: "Under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, DIY repairs don't void your warranty unless Tesla can prove your repair caused a subsequent failure. Document your work with photos."
  - q: "Can I just replace the motor instead of the full regulator?"
    a: "On most Tesla models, the motor and regulator are sold as one assembly. Separating them isn't practical for DIY repair."

Is your Tesla window stuck, moving slowly, or making grinding noises? The window regulator is likely the culprit. This is one of the more common repairs on aging Teslas, especially 2017-2021 Model 3 and Model S vehicles.

Tesla service centers charge **$400-800** for this repair. With this guide, you can do it yourself for **$80-150 in parts** and about 2 hours of work.

## Symptoms of a Failing Window Regulator

Before ordering parts, confirm the regulator is actually the problem:

- **Window moves slowly or unevenly** — the motor struggles against worn regulator tracks
- **Grinding or clicking noise** when operating the window
- **Window falls into the door** — the cable or mechanism has snapped
- **Window won't go up** but you hear the motor running
- **Window tilts or binds** instead of moving straight up/down

If the window doesn't respond at all and you hear nothing, check the window switch and fuses first—that's a different problem.

## Tools and Parts Needed

### Tools
- **10mm deep socket** with ratchet (regulator mounting nuts)
- **13mm socket** (glass clamp bolts)

## Step 1: Remove the Door Panel

The door panel removal is the same whether you're working on the front or rear windows.

1. **Lower the window partially** (if it still works) — this makes glass removal easier later

2. **Locate and remove the screws:**
   - Model 3/Y: Two T30 Torx screws behind small covers at the bottom of the panel
   - Model S: Three screws—two at bottom, one behind the door handle trim
   
3. **Pop off screw covers** using a plastic pry tool. They're delicate—work carefully.

4. **Disconnect the door panel** starting from the bottom:
   - Insert your trim tool between the panel and door frame
   - Work around the edges, releasing plastic clips
   - Lift the panel upward to unhook it from the window sill

5. **Disconnect electrical connectors:**
   - Window switch connector
   - Door handle cable (push the clip and slide off)
   - Puddle lamp connector (if equipped)
   - Take photos before disconnecting—you'll thank yourself later

6. **Set the panel aside** on a clean surface, face down on a towel to protect it.

## Step 2: Access the Window Regulator

With the door panel removed, you'll see a black plastic closeout panel covering the inner door cavity.

1. **Tape the window glass in the UP position:**
   - Use painter's tape across the door frame to hold the glass up
   - Apply tape on both sides of the glass for security
   - This prevents the glass from falling into the door when you disconnect it

2. **Remove the inner belt seal** — the rubber strip along the top of the door opening. It usually pulls off by hand.

3. **Remove the closeout panel:**
   - Carefully peel it away from the door frame
   - It's attached with adhesive and clips
   - Work slowly to avoid tearing—you'll reuse this panel

4. **Disconnect the 12V battery** (recommended by Tesla):
   - This is especially important if your car has side airbags
   - Wait 1 minute after disconnecting before proceeding
   - Location: Under the hood for Model 3/Y, front trunk for Model S

## Step 3: Remove the Old Regulator

Now you can see the window regulator mechanism inside the door cavity.

1. **Locate the access holes** — there are plastic plugs covering the regulator mounting nuts. Pop these out with a small screwdriver.

2. **Disconnect the window motor electrical connector** — it's clipped to the regulator. Press the release tab and pull straight out.

3. **Support the window glass** — have a helper hold it from inside the door, or ensure your tape is secure.

4. **Remove the glass mounting hardware:**
   - Loosen the bolts that clamp the glass to the regulator
   - Carefully lift the glass out of the regulator track
   - Rest the glass safely inside the door or remove it completely

5. **Remove the regulator mounting nuts:**
   - There are 4 nuts (10mm) holding the regulator to the door
   - Remove all four nuts completely

6. **Remove the regulator:**
   - There's also a clip attaching it to the door structure—pop this off
   - Maneuver the regulator out through the door opening
   - Tip: Remove one arm at a time, pivoting the assembly as you go
   - It takes some wiggling—be patient

## Step 4: Install the New Regulator

Before installation, compare the old and new regulators side-by-side to confirm you have the correct part.

1. **Position the new regulator:**
   - Feed it into the door cavity one arm at a time
   - Align the mounting studs with the holes in the door

2. **Install mounting nuts (hand-tight only for now):**
   - Thread all 4 nuts onto the studs
   - Don't tighten yet—you'll need adjustment room

3. **Reinstall the glass:**
   - Lower the glass into the regulator track carefully
   - Align the glass mounting bracket with the regulator clamps
   - Install the mounting bolts hand-tight

4. **Connect the motor electrical connector** — push until it clicks.

5. **Reconnect the 12V battery** so you can test and adjust.

## Step 5: Adjust and Final Torque

This is the critical step that determines whether your window seals properly.

1. **Loosen the lower regulator mounting nuts 3 turns** — this allows for angle adjustment

2. **Close the door** and raise the window fully using the switch

3. **Check alignment:**
   - Look at the gap between the glass and the door frame
   - The glass should be parallel to the frame, with even gaps all around
   - Check that it seals properly against the weather stripping

4. **Adjust if needed:**
   - Open the door
   - Turn the regulator mounting studs to change the glass angle
   - Use a 3mm Allen key on the jack screws to prevent them from spinning
   - Close door and recheck—repeat until aligned

5. **Final torque all fasteners:**
   - Regulator mounting nuts: **10 Nm (7.4 lb-ft)**
   - Glass clamp bolts: **9.5 Nm (7.0 lb-ft)**

## Step 6: Reassembly and Calibration

1. **Install the access hole plugs**

2. **Reinstall the closeout panel** — press firmly around the edges to reseal

3. **Reinstall the inner belt seal**

4. **Reconnect the door panel connectors:**
   - Puddle lamp
   - Door handle cable (slide and click)
   - Window switch

5. **Reinstall the door panel:**
   - Hook the top edge onto the window sill first
   - Press around the edges to snap clips back into place
   - Install screws and covers

6. **Calibrate the window regulator:**

   **Method 1 — Touchscreen (2024+ software):**
   - Go to Controls > Service > Window Calibration
   - Follow the on-screen prompts
   
   **Method 2 — Manual calibration:**
   - Close the window fully
   - Hold the window UP button for 5 seconds after it stops
   - Open the window fully
   - Hold the window DOWN button for 5 seconds after it stops
   - Close the window again — it should now auto-close properly

## Troubleshooting

**Window still doesn't work:**
- Check the motor connector is fully seated
- Verify the 12V battery is reconnected
- Check for blown fuses (owner's manual has locations)

**Window moves but is crooked:**
- Loosen the glass clamp bolts and regulator nuts
- Adjust until the glass is parallel to the frame
- Re-torque and retest

**Auto-close doesn't work:**
- Repeat the calibration procedure
- Some cars require the touchscreen calibration method

**Grinding noise persists:**
- Check for debris in the window track
- Verify the glass is properly seated in the regulator guides

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $250-400 | $150-400 | **$400-800** |
| Independent Shop | $150-250 | $100-200 | **$250-450** |
| DIY (this guide) | $80-150 | $0 | **$80-150** |

**Your savings: $300-650** by doing it yourself.
