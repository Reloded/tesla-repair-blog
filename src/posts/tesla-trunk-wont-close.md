A Tesla trunk that won't close properly is more than an inconvenience—it's a safety issue and can drain your 12V battery through repeated attempts. This common problem usually stems from latch misalignment, dirty sensors, or worn components. Most fixes take less than 30 minutes with basic tools.

## Common Causes of Trunk Closing Issues

Before grabbing your tools, identify which type of problem you're experiencing:

- **Trunk won't latch at all** - striker or latch misalignment
- **Trunk latches then pops open** - sensor or latch mechanism issue
- **Power trunk won't close automatically** - motor or sensor problem
- **Trunk closes but shows warning** - sensor needs cleaning or recalibration
- **Grinding or unusual sounds** - mechanical obstruction or worn parts

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### 1. Manual Override Close

If the power trunk won't work, try closing it manually:

1. Press the trunk button to stop any automatic movement
2. Gently pull the trunk down by hand
3. Apply firm pressure until you hear the latch click
4. If this works, the issue is likely the motor or sensor, not the latch

### 2. Clean the Latch and Sensors

Dirt and debris are often the culprit:

1. Open the trunk fully
2. Locate the latch mechanism on the trunk lid
3. Spray silicone lubricant on the latch
4. Wipe away debris with a microfiber cloth
5. Clean the striker on the body as well

<strong>Tip:</strong> Never use WD-40 on Tesla latches. Use silicone-based lubricant only, as petroleum products can damage rubber seals.
</div>

## Adjusting the Trunk Striker

If cleaning doesn't help, the striker likely needs adjustment:

**Step 1: Locate the Striker**
The striker is the U-shaped metal piece on the car body that the trunk latch grabs onto.

**Step 2: Loosen the Striker Bolts**
1. Use a T30 Torx screwdriver
2. Loosen bolts just enough to allow movement (don't remove completely)

**Step 3: Adjust Position**
- If trunk won't reach latch: move striker UP slightly
- If trunk is too tight: move striker DOWN slightly
- If trunk sits crooked: adjust LEFT or RIGHT

**Step 4: Test and Tighten**
1. Hold striker in new position
2. Close trunk gently to test alignment
3. When satisfied, tighten bolts firmly
4. Test automatic close function

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Make small adjustments only (1-2mm at a time). Large adjustments can cause the trunk to not seal properly, leading to water leaks.

## Fixing the Trunk Latch Mechanism

If the striker adjustment doesn't solve the problem:

### Check the Latch for Damage
1. Open the trunk and examine the latch assembly
2. Look for bent or broken components
3. Test that the latch releases and catches smoothly by hand

### Lubricate Moving Parts
1. Apply silicone spray to the latch mechanism
2. Open and close the latch by hand several times
3. Wipe away excess lubricant

### Replace the Latch (if necessary)
If the latch is damaged, replacement parts are available from Tesla or aftermarket suppliers. This is a straightforward bolt-on replacement.

## Sensor Reset Procedure

Sometimes the trunk sensor needs recalibration:

1. Open the trunk fully
2. Press and hold the close button for 10 seconds
3. Release and wait for any beeps
4. Close the trunk manually
5. Test the automatic function

For Model 3/Y specifically:
1. Go to **Controls > Service > Trunk**
2. Follow on-screen calibration instructions

## Power Trunk Motor Issues

If the trunk moves slowly or stops mid-travel:

- **Check for obstructions** in the hinge area
- **Listen for grinding sounds** indicating motor strain
- **Feel for resistance** when closing manually

Motor replacement is possible but typically requires Tesla Service due to calibration requirements.

## Preventing Future Issues

- **Clean latch monthly** with silicone lubricant
- **Don't slam the trunk** - let the power close work
- **Check weatherstripping** for debris buildup
- **Avoid overloading** which strains the hinges

## When to Visit Tesla Service

- Latch mechanism is physically broken
- Motor replacement needed
- Warning messages persist after adjustments
- Water leaks after striker adjustment

## Cost Comparison

| Fix | DIY Cost | Tesla Service |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| Lubrication | €10-15 | €100+ |
| Striker adjustment | €0 (tools only) | €150-200 |
| Latch replacement | €50-100 | €300-500 |
| Motor replacement | N/A | €400-700 |

Most trunk closing issues are simple alignment problems that take minutes to fix once you understand the mechanism.

*Regular maintenance of trunk components prevents most closing issues. A quick spray of lubricant every few months goes a long way.*
