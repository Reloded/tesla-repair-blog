Your Tesla's cooling system is critical for battery health and longevity. Unlike ICE vehicles that mostly cool the engine, Tesla's thermal management system regulates the **battery pack**, **drive units**, and **cabin climate**. Neglecting coolant maintenance can lead to reduced range, charging issues, and expensive component failures.

Here's how to flush and replace Tesla coolant yourself — a job that service centers charge **€300-600** for.

## When to Change Tesla Coolant

Tesla's official service intervals vary by model and year:

| Model | Service Interval | Capacity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Model S/X (pre-2021) | Every 4 years or 80,000 km | 10-12L total |
| Model S/X (2021+) | Every 4 years or 80,000 km | 8-10L total |
| Model 3/Y | Every 4 years or 80,000 km | 6-8L total |

**When to change sooner:**

- Coolant looks brown, murky, or has particles
- Low coolant warnings appear
- After cooling system repairs (pump, hose, superbottle)
- You live in extreme temperatures (accelerates degradation)
- Vehicle has over 150,000 km regardless of age

## The G-48 Coolant Requirement

⚠️ **Critical: Only use Tesla-approved G-48 coolant.**

Tesla's cooling system uses **ethylene glycol-based G-48 coolant** that's specifically formulated for aluminum components and high-voltage battery systems. Using the wrong coolant can cause:

- Corrosion of aluminum cooling channels
- Damage to seals and gaskets
- Reduced cooling efficiency
- Warranty claims denial

**Approved coolants:**
- Tesla OEM coolant (blue color)
- BASF Glysantin G48 (blue)
- Pentosin Pentofrost E (blue)
- Zerex G-48 Formula (blue)

**Do NOT use:**
- ❌ Green/yellow "universal" coolant
- ❌ Dex-Cool (orange)
- ❌ Asian vehicle coolants (pink/red)
- ❌ Any "all makes" coolant

The blue color is a key identifier — if your coolant has turned brown or green, that indicates contamination or degradation.

## Tools & Materials Needed

| Item | Purpose | Estimated Cost |
|------|---------|----------------|
| G-48 Coolant (8-12L) | Fresh coolant | €40-80 |
| Drain pan (10L capacity) | Catch old coolant | €15-25 |
| Spill-free funnel | No-mess refilling | €15-30 |
| Distilled water (10L) | For flushing | €5-10 |
| Refractometer (optional) | Test concentration | €20-40 |
| Jack + stands or lift | Access drain points | - |
| Basic socket set | Remove covers | - |

**Total DIY cost:** €80-150 (plus your time)
**Service center cost:** €300-600

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **Before starting:**

1. **Let the car cool down** — coolant can be hot. Wait at least 2 hours after driving.
2. **Do NOT open the coolant reservoir while hot** — pressurized system can spray hot coolant.
3. **Dispose of coolant properly** — it's toxic to animals and the environment. Take to a recycling center.
4. **Wear gloves and eye protection** — ethylene glycol is toxic if ingested or absorbed through skin.
5. **Work on level ground** — air bleeding requires a level vehicle.

## DIY vs Tesla Service Center Method

> **Important:** Tesla's official service procedure uses specialized equipment — vacuum refill systems, pressure test fixtures, and coolant drain adapter kits. They disconnect quick-release hose fittings rather than using traditional drain plugs.
>
> The DIY method below is a simplified approach that works for home mechanics without professional equipment. It's effective but takes longer (manual bleeding vs vacuum fill).

## Model 3/Y Coolant Change Procedure

The Model 3 and Y share similar cooling architectures. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle

1. Park on a level surface
2. Engage **Transport Mode** (optional but helps with access):
   - Controls → Service → Transport Mode
   - This lowers air suspension if equipped
3. Open the frunk to access the coolant reservoir
4. Let the car sit until completely cool

### Step 2: Drain the Old Coolant

The primary drain point is on the front motor/drive unit:

1. Raise and secure the front of the vehicle
2. Remove the underbody panel (aero shield) — multiple 10mm bolts and plastic clips
3. Locate the coolant hose quick-disconnect on the front drive unit (bottom, passenger side)
4. Position your drain pan under the drain point
5. Remove the coolant reservoir cap (frunk) to allow air in and faster draining
6. Disconnect the quick-release fitting — squeeze the release tabs and pull apart. Expect 4-6 liters to flow out

> **Note:** Tesla uses quick-disconnect hose fittings, not traditional drain plugs. These are push-to-connect fittings with release tabs. No torque spec needed — they simply click back together when reinstalling.

**For a more complete drain (recommended for flush):**

- There's a secondary drain on the rear drive unit (dual motor models)
- The battery coolant loop has its own drain point (advanced — see below)

### Step 3: Flush the System (Optional but Recommended)

For a thorough service, flush with distilled water:

1. Reinstall the drain plug (hand tight)
2. Fill the reservoir with distilled water until full
3. Run the climate system (heat to max) for 10-15 minutes
   - This circulates water through the entire loop including heater core
4. Let cool, then drain again
5. Repeat until water drains clear (usually 2-3 cycles)

**Pro tip:** Running the car's HVAC system is the only way to ensure coolant circulates through all loops. The thermal system has multiple valves that only open under certain conditions.

### Step 4: Refill with Fresh Coolant

1. Reconnect the quick-disconnect fitting — push together until you hear/feel a click. Tug to verify it's locked.
2. Attach the spill-free funnel to the reservoir
3. Slowly fill with G-48 coolant
4. Fill until coolant is visible in the reservoir (MIN to MAX marks)
5. Expect to use 4-5 liters initially (not all will fit immediately)

### Step 5: Bleed the Air (Critical!)

Air in the cooling system causes:
- Hot spots that damage the battery
- Reduced cooling efficiency
- Pump cavitation and premature failure
- Error codes and warnings

**Bleeding procedure for Model 3/Y:**

1. With reservoir cap off, turn on the climate to **maximum heat**
2. Let the car run for 15-20 minutes
3. Watch the reservoir — you'll see bubbles rising as air escapes
4. Keep topping off as the level drops (air leaves, coolant takes its place)
5. Gently squeeze coolant hoses (accessible in frunk) to help dislodge air pockets
6. Continue until no more bubbles appear (can take 30+ minutes)
7. Take a short drive (5-10 minutes) with heat on, then recheck level

**Important:** The battery cooling loop is separate from the cabin loop. To bleed the battery loop:

1. Plug in a charger and begin charging
2. This activates the battery thermal management
3. Monitor for bubbles while charging
4. Top off as needed

### Step 6: Final Checks

1. Check coolant level with car level and cool — should be between MIN and MAX
2. Inspect drain plug for leaks
3. Reinstall underbody panels
4. Clear any warning codes via touchscreen or OBD tool
5. Monitor coolant level over the next week — some additional bleeding may occur naturally

## Model S/X Coolant Change

The older Model S and X have more complex cooling systems with multiple loops:

### Key Differences

- **Larger capacity:** 10-12 liters total system volume
- **Multiple reservoirs:** Some years have separate battery and drivetrain reservoirs
- **More drain points:** Front drive unit, rear drive unit, battery loop
- **MCU1 vs MCU2:** Different software interfaces for diagnostics

### Additional Steps for S/X

1. **Battery loop drain (if doing full flush):**
   - Located under the car, toward the center
   - Requires removing additional underbody panels
   - More coolant volume — ensure large enough drain pan

2. **Reservoir differences:**
   - Pre-refresh S/X: Check both reservoirs (front and rear)
   - 2021+ refresh: Similar to Model 3/Y single reservoir system

3. **Air bleeding takes longer** due to larger system volume — allow 45+ minutes of running with heat on max.

## Troubleshooting

### Coolant Level Drops After Service

Normal for the first few days as air bleeds out. Check daily and top off as needed. If level continues dropping after a week, check for leaks at:

- Drain plug
- Hose connections
- Superbottle (Model 3/Y)
- Pump seals

### "Coolant Level Low" Warning After Service

1. Top off the reservoir to MAX
2. Run the car with heat on high for 20 minutes
3. Drive for 10 minutes
4. Recheck and top off
5. If warning persists, there may be a large air pocket — repeat bleeding

### Brown or Contaminated Coolant

If old coolant was severely degraded:

1. Do multiple distilled water flushes (3-4 cycles)
2. Consider a chemical flush product (ensure it's aluminum-safe)
3. Inspect hoses and connections for damage
4. Check for signs of mixing (someone used wrong coolant type)

### Car Overheating After Service

Air pocket preventing proper circulation:

1. Stop driving immediately
2. Let cool completely
3. Check coolant level (may be very low from air displacement)
4. Repeat bleeding procedure more thoroughly
5. If overheating continues, seek professional service

## What About Battery Coolant vs. Motor Coolant?

Tesla uses an integrated thermal management system, but there are separate loops:

| Loop | What It Cools | Connected? |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Battery loop | Battery pack | Yes, via valves |
| Drive unit loop | Motor, inverter | Yes, via valves |
| Cabin loop | Heater core | Yes, via heat pump |

The superbottle (Model 3/Y) or octovalve manages these loops. When you run the heater and charger simultaneously, all loops circulate — this is why both methods are needed for complete bleeding.

## Coolant Testing with Refractometer

A digital refractometer can verify:

- **Concentration:** Should read -37°C to -40°C freeze protection (50/50 mix)
- **Degradation:** Compare to fresh coolant sample
- **Contamination:** Any unusual readings indicate problems

To test:

1. Place a few drops on the refractometer lens
2. Read the freeze point
3. Standard mix should show -37°C to -40°C
4. If reading is warmer (e.g., -20°C), coolant is diluted — drain and refill with correct mix

## Cost Comparison

| Method | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| DIY (this guide) | €80-150 | 2-3 hours work |
| Tesla Service Center | €300-450 | 1-hour labor + parts |
| Independent Shop | €150-250 | Varies by location |
| Mobile Service | €250-350 | Convenience premium |

**DIY savings:** €150-350 depending on your area.

## When to Leave It to Professionals

Consider professional service if:

- You've never worked on cooling systems before
- Your car has active leaks (diagnosis needed first)
- Coolant is severely contaminated (may indicate failed component)
- You don't have access to a lift or jack stands
- You're uncomfortable with the bleeding procedure

## Conclusion

Coolant maintenance is one of the most overlooked services for Tesla owners. While the cars don't have many traditional maintenance needs, the thermal management system is critical for battery longevity and performance.

A coolant flush every 4 years or 80,000 km keeps your battery and drive units running cool, which means:

- **Better range retention** over time
- **Faster charging** at Superchargers
- **Longer component life** for expensive parts
- **Peace of mind** knowing your cooling system is healthy

With basic tools and patience for the air bleeding process, this is a very achievable DIY service that saves hundreds in service costs.
