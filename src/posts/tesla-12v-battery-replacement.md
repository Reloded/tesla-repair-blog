The low-voltage battery in your Tesla is one of the most common components that will eventually need replacement. Despite having a massive high-voltage battery pack, every Tesla relies on a smaller auxiliary battery to power essential systems like the computer, door locks, and lights. When this battery fails, your Tesla won't start—even with a fully charged main battery.

**Important:** Tesla has used three different low-voltage battery types:
- **Pre-late 2021:** 12V lead-acid (replaceable with aftermarket options)
- **Late 2021–2023:** 12V lithium-ion (NMC or LFP chemistry)
- **2024+ (Highland, Juniper):** 16V lithium-ion (completely different system)

This guide focuses on the 12V batteries. If you have a 2024+ vehicle with a 16V system, the replacement process and parts are different—check your owner's manual or Tesla service documentation.

## Signs Your Tesla 12V Battery Needs Replacement

Before diving into the replacement process, here's how to know if your 12V battery is failing:

- **"12V Battery Low" warning** on your touchscreen (if your [screen went black](/posts/tesla-screen-black-fix/) before the warning, the battery may already be dead)
- Car won't wake up or respond to the app
- [Doors won't open](/posts/tesla-door-handle-not-working/) with the key card or phone key
- Random system reboots while driving
- Clicking sound when trying to start
- The car loses settings overnight

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> If your car is completely dead, you'll need to manually open the frunk using the emergency release. On Model 3/Y, this requires connecting a 12V power source to the terminals behind the tow hook cover.
</div>

## What You'll Need

For this job, you'll need basic tools and about 30-60 minutes. Tesla service centers charge $200-400+ for this repair, but you can do it yourself for around $80-150 depending on the battery you choose.

**Battery Options (for 12V systems only):**

*Lead-acid vehicles (pre-late 2021):*
- **OEM Lead-Acid** (~€80-120): Direct replacement, 3-4 year lifespan
- **Ohmmu/Antigravity Lithium Upgrade** (~€250-350): Lighter, 8+ year lifespan, popular upgrade

*12V Lithium-ion vehicles (late 2021–2023):*
- **Tesla OEM Lithium** (~€200-300): Must match chemistry (NMC or LFP)
- Tesla recommends attempting recovery before replacement—these batteries can often be revived

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Don't mix battery types:</strong> Never put a lead-acid battery in a car designed for lithium-ion, or vice versa. The charging systems are calibrated differently and you can cause damage.
</div>

## Step-by-Step Replacement Guide

### Model 3 and Model Y

**Step 1: Access the Battery Compartment**

The 12V battery is located in the front trunk (frunk) on the right side, under a plastic cover.

1. Open the frunk
2. Remove the plastic storage bin (just lifts out)
3. Locate the black plastic cover on the right side
4. Remove the clips securing the cover using plastic pry tools

**Step 2: Disconnect the Old Battery**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety First:</strong> Always disconnect the negative terminal first, then the positive. This prevents short circuits.
</div>

1. Use a 10mm socket to loosen the **negative (black) terminal** first
2. Move the negative cable aside
3. Loosen the **positive (red) terminal**
4. Remove the positive cable
5. Remove the battery hold-down bracket (10mm bolts)
6. Carefully lift out the old battery

**Step 3: Install the New Battery**

1. Lower the new battery into position
2. Reinstall the hold-down bracket
3. Connect the **positive (red) terminal** first
4. Connect the **negative (black) terminal** last
5. Tighten both terminals securely

**Step 4: Reassemble and Test**

1. Replace the plastic cover
2. Reinstall the storage bin
3. Close the frunk
4. The car should wake up immediately
5. Check for any warning messages on the screen

### Model S and Model X

The process is similar but the battery location differs:

**Model S (Pre-2021):** Battery is located in the frunk, similar position to Model 3
**Model S (2021+):** Battery is under the rear seat
**Model X:** Battery is under the second-row seats

For these models, you'll need to remove additional trim pieces to access the battery.

## After Replacement

Once the new battery is installed:

1. **Let the car sit for 10-15 minutes** to allow systems to initialize
2. **Check for error messages** - some may need to be cleared
3. **Reset the BMS** (Battery Management System) by leaving the car asleep for 8+ hours
4. **Update settings** if any were reset (clock, driver profile, etc.)

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you upgrade to a lithium 12V battery, no software changes are needed. The car will manage it automatically.
</div>

## How Long Does a Tesla 12V Battery Last?

- **Lead-Acid batteries:** 3-5 years typically
- **Lithium batteries:** 7-10+ years expected
- Frequent Sentry Mode use drains the 12V battery faster
- Extreme temperatures reduce lifespan

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Connecting terminals in wrong order** - Always negative last when connecting, negative first when disconnecting
2. **Using the wrong battery size** - Tesla uses specific group sizes
3. **Not securing the hold-down** - A loose battery can shift and short out
4. **Overtightening terminals** - Can crack the battery posts

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $250-400+ | Labor + markup |
| DIY Lead-Acid | $80-120 | Easy, standard lifespan |
| DIY Lithium (OEM) | $200-300 | Longer lifespan |
| DIY Lithium (Ohmmu) | $300-350 | Premium option |

By doing this repair yourself, you save at least $100-200 compared to Tesla service, and you'll know exactly what battery was installed.
