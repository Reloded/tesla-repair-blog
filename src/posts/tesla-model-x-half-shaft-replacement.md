The half-shafts (also called CV axles or drive shafts) on your Tesla Model X transfer power from the drive unit to the wheels. Over time, the CV joints can wear out, boots can tear, and the shaft can develop play. Tesla service centers charge **€1,500-2,500+** per half-shaft, but with salvage parts, you can do this repair yourself for €200-400.

## Symptoms of a Bad Half-Shaft

- Clicking or popping noise when turning
- Vibration at highway speeds
- Clunking when accelerating from a stop
- Grease splattered on the inside of the wheel
- Torn CV boot visible during inspection
- Play or looseness when grabbing the shaft

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Don't ignore these symptoms.</strong> A failing half-shaft can eventually break completely, leaving you stranded and potentially causing damage to other drivetrain components.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Parts:**
- Replacement half-shaft (verify front or rear, left or right)
- New axle nut (recommended — they're often one-time use)
- Source: Tesla salvage yards, aftermarket suppliers

**Expected Cost:**
- Tesla Service Center: €1,500-2,500+ per side
- DIY with salvage shaft: €200-400
- DIY with aftermarket shaft: €300-500

**Tools:**
- Floor jack and jack stands
- 36mm axle nut socket (deep socket)
- 1/2" breaker bar (the axle nut is TIGHT)
- 18mm socket for wheel bolts
- Ball joint separator or pickle fork
- Large pry bar
- Dead blow hammer
- Penetrating oil (PB Blaster or similar)
- Torque wrench capable of 350+ Nm

## Front vs Rear Half-Shafts

**Model X Rear (most common failure):**
- Connects rear drive unit to rear wheels
- Higher torque = more stress = more common failure
- Dual motor models have both front and rear

**Model X Front:**
- Connects front drive unit to front wheels
- Less common failure but same replacement process

Always verify which shaft you need before ordering. Left and right are different.

## Step-by-Step Replacement

### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle

1. Park on a flat, level surface
2. Loosen the wheel bolts while on the ground
3. Loosen the axle nut while on the ground (with someone pressing the brake)
4. The axle nut requires significant force — use the breaker bar

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Spray penetrating oil on the axle nut the night before. These nuts are torqued to 350 Nm and can be very difficult to remove.
</div>

### Step 2: Lift and Secure the Vehicle

1. Jack up the car at the proper lift point
2. Place jack stands securely under the frame
3. Remove the wheel
4. Remove the axle nut completely

### Step 3: Disconnect the Suspension

To remove the half-shaft, you need to create enough room for it to slide out. This typically requires disconnecting:

**Option A: Lower ball joint (easier)**
1. Remove the pinch bolt on the lower ball joint
2. Use a ball joint separator to pop the joint loose
3. Pull the hub/knuckle outward to create space

**Option B: Entire knuckle removal (more work but more room)**
1. Disconnect the brake caliper and hang it with wire
2. Remove the caliper bracket
3. Disconnect all control arms from the knuckle
4. Remove the knuckle completely

For most Model X half-shaft jobs, Option A is sufficient.

### Step 4: Remove the Old Half-Shaft

**Outer end (wheel side):**
1. Push the hub assembly outward
2. The splined shaft should slide out of the hub
3. If stuck, use a dead blow hammer on the end (protect the threads)
4. Do NOT hammer directly on the threads

**Inner end (drive unit side):**
1. The inner CV joint clips into the drive unit
2. Use a pry bar between the joint and drive unit
3. Pry firmly but carefully — it should pop out
4. Catch any gear oil that may drip out

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Some gear oil will likely come out when you remove the inner CV joint. Have a drain pan ready and check the oil level after installation.
</div>

### Step 5: Compare Old and New Shafts

Before installing:
1. Lay both shafts side by side
2. Verify they're the same length
3. Check that the spline count matches on both ends
4. Verify the retaining ring is present on the inner CV joint

### Step 6: Install the New Half-Shaft

**Inner end first:**
1. Ensure the retaining ring is properly seated on the inner joint
2. Align the splines with the drive unit
3. Push firmly until you feel/hear it click into place
4. Verify it's locked by trying to pull it back out

**Outer end:**
1. Slide the splined end through the wheel hub
2. You may need to wiggle and rotate to align the splines
3. Hand-thread the new axle nut a few turns

### Step 7: Reconnect Suspension

1. Reconnect the lower ball joint
2. Install and torque the pinch bolt (refer to service manual for spec)
3. Or reassemble the knuckle if you removed it completely

### Step 8: Final Torque and Assembly

1. Install the wheel and hand-tighten the bolts
2. Lower the car to the ground
3. Torque the axle nut to **350 Nm (258 ft-lb)** with someone pressing the brake
4. Torque wheel bolts to **175 Nm (129 ft-lb)**
5. Stake the axle nut if required (bend the collar into the groove)

### Step 9: Check Gear Oil Level

The drive unit may have lost oil during the removal:
1. Locate the fill plug on the drive unit
2. Remove and check the level
3. Top off with the correct Tesla-approved gear oil if needed
4. Reinstall the fill plug

## Post-Installation

1. Test drive at low speed first
2. Listen for any clicking or unusual sounds
3. Make several turns in both directions
4. Gradually increase speed and check for vibrations
5. Re-check the axle nut torque after 50-100 km

## Troubleshooting

**Clicking still present after replacement:**
- Verify the inner joint is fully seated
- Check that you replaced the correct side
- The other half-shaft may also be worn

**Vibration at speed:**
- Axle nut may not be tight enough
- Half-shaft may not be fully seated in hub
- Wheel balance issue (rebalance wheels)

**Oil leak from drive unit:**
- Inner seal may have been damaged during removal
- Check seal and replace if necessary
- Top off gear oil

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | €1,500-2,500+ | Per side, includes alignment |
| DIY with salvage shaft | €200-400 | Most economical |
| DIY with aftermarket | €300-500 | New with warranty |
| DIY with OEM new | €800-1,200 | From Tesla parts |

## Where to Find Parts

- **Tesla salvage yards** — Best value, verify condition
- **Aftermarket suppliers** — New shafts with warranty available
- **eBay** — Search "Tesla Model X half shaft" or "CV axle"
- **Tesla parts department** — Most expensive but guaranteed fit

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Buying salvage:</strong> Ask for photos of the CV boots and joints. Avoid shafts with torn boots or visible damage. A shaft with intact boots usually has life left in the joints.

*Half-shaft replacement is one of the more involved DIY repairs, but it's well within reach of a home mechanic with the right tools. The key is patience, proper torque specs, and making sure everything is fully seated before buttoning up.*
