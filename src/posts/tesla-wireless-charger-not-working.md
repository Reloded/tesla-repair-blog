The wireless phone charger built into the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y center console is one of those features you don't think about until it stops working. You drop your phone on the pad, glance down five minutes later, and the battery hasn't moved. Or worse, your phone is hot enough to cook breakfast on.

These are both common problems, and most of the time you can fix them without visiting a service center.

## How the Tesla Wireless Charger Works

The center console wireless charger uses the Qi standard and delivers up to 15W of power. It has two charging pads — one for the driver's phone and one for the passenger's. The charger only works when the vehicle is powered on (touchscreen active), unless Sentry Mode or Camp Mode is keeping the system alive.

A few things to know upfront:

- The charger activates about 2-3 seconds after placing your phone
- Phones will get warm during wireless charging — that's normal for any Qi charger
- The charger won't work when the 12V battery is depleted or the car is fully off
- Pre-2021 Model 3 vehicles may not have a factory wireless charger at all

## Common Problems and How to Fix Them

### 1. Phone Case Blocking the Charge

This is the number one reason the charger "stops working." Thick cases, metal cases, or cases with magnetic accessories (like ring holders or old magnetic mounts) can prevent the Qi signal from reaching your phone.

**The fix:**

- Try charging with the case removed. If it works, the case is the problem
- Switch to a thin, Qi-compatible case — most cases under 3mm work fine
- Remove any metal plates, magnetic ring holders, or credit cards from behind the case
- MagSafe cases generally work, but the magnets can occasionally cause alignment issues on the Tesla pad

If you're using an iPhone with a thick case and don't want to switch, try placing the phone upside down (screen facing up, top of phone toward you). This repositions the charging coil closer to the pad's sweet spot. Multiple Tesla owners have reported this fix works.

### 2. Phone Overheating and Stopping the Charge

This is the second most common complaint. Your phone starts charging, gets hot, then stops with a temperature warning. This happens more often in summer or when the cabin is already warm.

Tesla's wireless charger lacks active cooling — there's no fan underneath the pad, unlike some newer EVs from other manufacturers. The charging coil generates heat, and in a sun-baked cabin, the phone can hit thermal limits quickly.

**The fix:**

- Turn on climate control or [Cabin Overheat Protection](/posts/tesla-climate-keeper-issues/) before getting in the car
- Put your phone in Low Power Mode before placing it on the charger — this reduces background processing and heat generation
- Remove the case while charging to allow better heat dissipation
- Avoid charging while running navigation and streaming simultaneously — all three generate significant heat
- Place the phone upside down to shift the coil alignment and reduce localized hot spots
- Park in shade when possible, or use a sunshade

If overheating is constant regardless of conditions, the charging module itself may have a fault. Jump to the replacement section below.

### 3. Phone Not Detected at All

You place the phone down and nothing happens — no charging icon, no warmth, nothing.

**Step-by-step troubleshooting:**

1. **Check the car is on** — the touchscreen must be active. Sit in the driver's seat or press the brake pedal
2. **Remove everything from the pad** — key cards, coins, AirPods cases, or any other objects between the phone and charger surface
3. **Try the other pad** — if the passenger side works but the driver side doesn't, the issue is isolated to one charging coil
4. **Try a different phone** — this rules out a phone-side problem
5. **Reboot the touchscreen** — hold both scroll wheels on the steering wheel for about 10 seconds until the Tesla logo appears. This resets the MCU and can fix software glitches affecting the charger
6. **Check for software updates** — go to Controls > Software on the touchscreen. Some updates have addressed wireless charging bugs

If none of these work, the wireless charger module may need replacement.

### 4. Intermittent Charging (Starts and Stops)

The phone keeps connecting and disconnecting from the charger, sometimes making repeated notification sounds.

**Common causes and fixes:**

- **Vibrations from driving** — the phone shifts slightly on the pad and loses alignment. A thin non-slip pad or MagSafe-compatible mount can help
- **Phone case is borderline too thick** — it works sometimes but not consistently. Try a thinner case
- **Software bug** — do a scroll wheel reboot (hold both wheels for 10 seconds)
- **Worn charging module** — if the issue persists across multiple phones and reboots, the module is likely failing

### 5. Only One Side Works

If one charging pad works and the other doesn't, the issue is almost certainly hardware. Each pad has its own coil, but they share a single module in most configurations.

Try a touchscreen reboot first. If the problem persists, you'll need to replace the wireless charger module or have Tesla service look at it.

## Replacing the Wireless Charger Module

If troubleshooting doesn't solve the problem, the charging module can be replaced. This is a straightforward job on the Model 3 and Model Y.

**What you need to know:**

- The module sits under the center console phone dock area
- OEM part number varies by year — **1541234-00-B** (pre-2024) and **1755100-00-D** (2024+) are common part numbers found on the Model 3 and Model Y
- Vehicles built after March 2024 use a slightly different mounting design (screw-secured phone dock) per Tesla's service documentation
- Used OEM modules run $50-150 on eBay; aftermarket MagSafe-compatible replacements cost $30-80

**General replacement steps:**

1. Power off the vehicle (Controls > Safety > Power Off, then wait 2 minutes)
2. Remove the center console phone dock trim — use a plastic trim tool to gently pry up the rubber pad and surrounding trim
3. Disconnect the wiring harness from the old module
4. Remove mounting screws or clips holding the module in place
5. Install the new module and reconnect the harness
6. Reassemble the trim and power on the vehicle
7. Test with a phone to confirm both pads work

> **Note:** Part numbers and mounting configurations changed over the production years. Double-check that the replacement module matches your vehicle's build date before ordering. You can find your build date in Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information on the touchscreen.

## Aftermarket Upgrade: MagSafe-Compatible Chargers

One popular upgrade is replacing the stock charger with a MagSafe-compatible unit. These use magnets to align the phone perfectly every time, which solves both the alignment and intermittent charging problems in one shot.

Aftermarket options from brands like TAPTES and TWRAPS are designed as drop-in replacements. They typically provide 15W charging with proper magnetic alignment and cost $40-80.

**Benefits of upgrading:**

- Consistent alignment means consistent charging
- Stronger magnetic hold prevents vibration disconnects while driving
- Some units include better thermal management than the stock pad
- Compatible with MagSafe cases (iPhone) and magnetic cases (Android)

**Things to watch:**

- Make sure the unit fits your specific model year — pre-2021, 2021-2023, and 2024+ Highland have different console designs
- Check reviews for your specific phone model — some chargers fit certain phone sizes better than others

## When to Schedule Tesla Service

Book a service appointment if:

- Both pads stopped working simultaneously after a software update (may indicate a firmware issue Tesla can fix remotely)
- You see burn marks or discoloration on the charging pad surface
- The charger worked fine, then suddenly died — could be a wiring harness issue
- Your vehicle is under warranty — wireless charger replacement is covered under the basic 4-year/50,000-mile warranty

You can schedule service through the Tesla app under Service > Request Service.

## Quick Reference Table

| Problem | Most Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Won't charge at all | Thick/metal case | Remove case, try thinner one |
| Phone overheats | No active cooling + warm cabin | Low Power Mode, climate control, remove case |
| Intermittent charging | Alignment shifts while driving | MagSafe case or aftermarket charger |
| One side dead | Failed charging coil | Replace wireless charger module |
| Stops after update | Software bug | Scroll wheel reboot |

## Final Thoughts

Most Tesla wireless charger problems come down to phone cases and heat management. Start with the free fixes — remove the case, reboot the touchscreen, try flipping the phone upside down. If the hardware itself has failed, replacement modules are affordable and the swap takes about 30 minutes with basic tools.
