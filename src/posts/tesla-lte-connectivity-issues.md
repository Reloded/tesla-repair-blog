Tesla vehicles use LTE cellular connectivity for features like traffic data, streaming music, and remote access through the Tesla app. When connectivity issues occur, many features become unavailable. This guide helps you troubleshoot cellular problems.

## Understanding Tesla Connectivity

### Standard Connectivity (Free)

All Teslas include basic features:

- Navigation with maps (downloaded on WiFi)
- Supercharger location
- Software updates (via WiFi)
- Remote access via app (limited)

### Premium Connectivity ($9.99/month)

Subscription adds:

- Live traffic visualization
- Satellite view maps
- Video streaming (Netflix, YouTube)
- Music streaming (Spotify, etc.)
- In-car web browser
- Live Sentry Mode view

## Common LTE Issues

Identify your problem:

- **No signal bars** - Complete loss of cellular
- **Weak signal** - Intermittent connectivity
- **"Connectivity issues"** message
- **Streaming not working** - Despite showing signal
- **App can't reach car** - Remote features unavailable

## Quick Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Signal Strength

Look at the top right of your screen for cellular bars:

- **4-5 bars:** Strong signal
- **2-3 bars:** Moderate signal
- **1 bar:** Weak signal
- **No bars:** No cellular connection

### Step 2: Restart the System

A soft reboot often restores connectivity:

1. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. Wait for system to restart
3. Allow 2-3 minutes for cellular reconnection
4. Check signal strength

### Step 3: Power Cycle

If soft reboot doesn't help:

1. Go to **Controls > Safety > Power Off**
2. Wait 3 minutes without touching anything
3. Press brake pedal to wake car
4. Check connectivity

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After a power cycle, it may take 5-10 minutes for all connectivity features to fully restore. Be patient before assuming the problem persists.
</div>

## Premium Connectivity Troubleshooting

### Verify Subscription Status

1. Go to **Controls > Software**
2. Select **Additional Vehicle Information**
3. Check Premium Connectivity status
4. If expired, features will be limited

### Subscription Issues

If your subscription should be active:

- Check Tesla account online for payment status
- Verify credit card is current
- Contact Tesla support if billing issues
- May take 24 hours for subscription changes to reflect

## Coverage and Location Issues

### Poor Coverage Areas

LTE connectivity depends on carrier coverage:

- **Rural areas** may have limited signal
- **Underground parking** blocks cellular
- **Dense urban areas** can have congestion
- **Mountain regions** often have spotty coverage

### International Travel

Tesla LTE may not work in all countries:

- Check if your region supports Tesla connectivity
- Roaming depends on carrier agreements
- Some features may be limited internationally

## Antenna and Hardware Issues

### Antenna Location

Tesla's LTE antenna is typically:

- **Model 3/Y:** In the roof or rear glass
- **Model S/X:** Various locations depending on year
- Damage to these areas can affect reception

### Signs of Hardware Problems

- Connectivity worked, then permanently stopped
- Never gets more than 1 bar anywhere
- WiFi works perfectly but LTE never connects
- Error messages about modem or connectivity hardware

## WiFi as Alternative

When LTE isn't available:

### Using WiFi Hotspot

1. Enable hotspot on your phone
2. Connect Tesla to phone's WiFi
3. Get most connectivity features via phone data
4. Streaming will use your phone's data plan

### WiFi-Only Features

Some features only work on WiFi regardless:

- Software update downloads
- Large map updates
- Theater mode downloads

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Using your phone as a hotspot for Tesla streaming can quickly consume your mobile data allowance. Monitor your usage.
</div>

## App Connectivity Issues

### Can't Reach Car from App

If the Tesla app shows car as unavailable:

1. **Check car's cellular signal** when at the car
2. **Verify app is updated** to latest version
3. **Re-login to app** if needed
4. **Check phone's internet connection**

### App Features Not Working

Some app features require:

- Premium Connectivity active
- Car in cellular coverage area
- Car not in deep sleep mode
- Both car and phone online

## MCU and Modem Issues

### Older Model S/X Considerations

Pre-2018 vehicles with MCU1 may have:

- Slower cellular modems
- Less reliable connectivity
- 3G sunset affecting some models
- [MCU upgrade](/posts/tesla-mcu-touchscreen-upgrade/) available ($1500-2500)

### When Modem Fails

Signs of modem failure:

- Complete loss of cellular permanently
- No improvement after reboots
- WiFi works but LTE never connects
- Service appointment required

## When to Contact Tesla Service

Reach out for service if:

- No cellular signal in known coverage areas
- Connectivity worked, then permanently stopped
- Error messages about modem hardware
- Antenna damage visible
- MCU issues affecting multiple features

### Service Appointment Tips

Before your appointment:

- Document when issues started
- Note if anything changed (accident, service, etc.)
- Screenshot any error messages
- Check if WiFi connectivity works normally

## Cost Considerations

| Issue | Typical Cost |
|-------|--------------|
| Software fix | Often free |
| Modem replacement | $500-1000 |
| Antenna repair | $300-600 |
| MCU1 upgrade | $1500-2500 |
