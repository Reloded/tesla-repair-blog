Tesla tires wear faster than you might expect—especially on performance-focused models. The combination of instant torque, heavy vehicle weight, and aggressive traction control means tire rotations are essential for maximizing tire life. Tesla charges $50-100 for this service, but it's an easy DIY job.

## Why Tesla Tires Wear Faster

Several factors contribute to faster tire wear on Teslas:

- **Instant torque** - Electric motors deliver full torque immediately, causing more tire slip
- **Heavy vehicle weight** - Battery packs add significant weight
- **Performance tires** - Many Teslas come with soft compound tires for grip
- **Aggressive traction control** - Constant micro-adjustments wear tires
- **Rear-wheel bias** - RWD and AWD models put more stress on rear tires

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Typical Tesla Tire Lifespan:</strong> 25,000-40,000 miles depending on driving style, tire compound, and rotation frequency. Without rotations, rear tires may wear out in 15,000-20,000 miles.
</div>

## Rotation Schedule

**Recommended interval:** Every 6,250 miles (or at each tire shop visit)

Tesla recommends rotating tires at every service interval, which is roughly 12,500 miles. However, due to faster wear, many owners rotate every 5,000-7,500 miles for best results.

## Rotation Patterns by Drivetrain

The rotation pattern depends on your Tesla's drivetrain configuration:

### Non-Directional Tires (Same Size All Around)

Per [Tesla's official rotation pattern](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Model3/ServiceManual/2024/en-us/GUID-7A200CAC-C2A5-4828-A96D-E49550FA1E85.html):

- **Front left → Rear right** (crosses to opposite side)
- **Front right → Rear left** (crosses to opposite side)
- **Rear left → Front left** (stays same side)
- **Rear right → Front right** (stays same side)

This is a "rearward cross" pattern—front tires cross to opposite rear, rear tires move straight forward.

### Directional Tires

If your tires have arrows indicating rotation direction:
- Front left → Rear left (same side only)
- Front right → Rear right (same side only)
- Rear left → Front left
- Rear right → Front right

**Do not** swap directional tires from left to right.

### Staggered Wheels (Different Front/Rear Sizes)

If your Tesla has different sized wheels front and rear (common on Performance models):

**You cannot rotate front-to-rear.** Only rotate:
- Front left ↔ Front right
- Rear left ↔ Rear right

This is called a **side-to-side rotation**. It's less effective but still helps even out wear.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Check Your Tires:</strong> Before rotating, verify if your tires are directional (they can only rotate one way) or asymmetric. Directional tires can only swap side-to-side on the same axle.
</div>

## Step-by-Step DIY Rotation

### Preparation

1. Park on a flat, level surface
2. Enable **Jack Mode**: Controls > Service > Jack Mode
3. Gather all tools
4. If checking tire pressure, do it before starting (cold tires)

### The Rotation Process

**Step 1: Break Lug Nuts Loose**

While the car is still on the ground with weight on the tires:
- Use the breaker bar with 21mm socket
- Loosen each lug nut 1/4 to 1/2 turn
- Do this for all four wheels before lifting

**Step 2: Lift the Vehicle**

You have two options:

**Option A - One Corner at a Time:**
1. Lift one corner
2. Place on jack stand
3. Remove wheel
4. Move to the corner it's going to
5. Repeat for each wheel

**Option B - All Four Corners (Faster):**
1. Lift and support all four corners on jack stands
2. Remove all wheels
3. Swap according to rotation pattern
4. This requires 4 jack stands

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Jack Puck Required:</strong> Always use a Tesla-specific jack puck or pad when lifting. The battery pack is exposed and can be damaged by a standard jack. See our <a href="/posts/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/">complete jack points guide</a> for exact locations on every model.
</div>

**Step 3: Reinstall Wheels**

1. Hand-thread lug nuts to prevent cross-threading
2. Snug them down with the socket
3. Lower the car partially (wheel touching ground with some weight)
4. Torque in a **star pattern** to **129 ft-lbs** (Model 3/Y) or **175 ft-lbs** (Model S/X - check your manual)
5. Lower fully and remove jack

**Step 4: Calibrate Tire Pressure**

Per Tesla's procedure, after rotation you should calibrate the tire pressure sensors:

1. Go to **Service > Calibrate Tire Pressure** on the touchscreen
2. Tap **Calibrate**
3. Drive for 10-15 minutes at varying speeds

**Note:** Vehicles with BLE TPMS (newer models) may not have this calibration routine—they auto-calibrate.

## Post-Rotation Checklist

- [ ] All lug nuts torqued to spec
- [ ] Jack mode disabled
- [ ] Tire pressures correct (check after driving)
- [ ] No TPMS warnings (or reset in progress)
- [ ] Test drive for any vibrations

## Cost Comparison

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Tesla Service Center | $50-75 |
| Tire Shop | $25-50 |
| Discount Tire (with purchase) | Free |
| DIY | Free (after tool investment) |

## Additional Tips

### Checking Tire Wear

While the tires are off, check tread depth:
- New tires: 10/32" to 11/32"
- Replace at: 4/32" (wet weather) or 2/32" (legal minimum)
- Use a tread depth gauge or the penny test

### Common Wear Patterns and Causes

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Center wear | Over-inflation | Reduce pressure |
| Edge wear | Under-inflation | Increase pressure |
| One-sided wear | Alignment issue | Get alignment |
| Cupping/scalloping | Suspension problem | Inspect suspension |

### When to Skip DIY

Consider professional service if:
- You notice [alignment issues](/posts/tesla-wheel-alignment-diy/) (pulling, uneven wear)
- Wheels need balancing (vibration at highway speeds)
- You're uncomfortable with the process
- You need tires dismounted and remounted

*Regular tire rotations are one of the simplest ways to extend tire life and save money on replacements. The $50-100 savings per rotation adds up quickly.*
