Winter driving in a Tesla is actually fantastic—instant torque, low center of gravity, and excellent traction control make EVs surprisingly capable in snow. But cold weather does affect range and requires some preparation. This guide covers everything you need to do before temperatures drop.

## Winter's Impact on Your Tesla

Before diving into preparation, understand what cold does to your car:

| Effect | Impact | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Reduced range | 20-40% less in extreme cold | Precondition, efficient driving |
| Slower charging | Battery heats before fast charging | Precondition before Supercharging |
| Regen limited | Dotted line on power meter | Normal—improves as battery warms |
| Door handles/windows | Can freeze shut | Treat seals, preheat car |
| Tire pressure drops | ~1 PSI per 10°F/5°C drop | Check and adjust monthly |

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Good News:</strong> Teslas handle winter better than most cars. No engine to warm up, no transmission issues, and the heavy battery pack provides excellent stability on slippery roads.
</div>

## Pre-Winter Checklist

### 1. Tires: Your Most Important Upgrade

Summer tires become dangerously hard below 7°C (45°F). Even all-seasons compromise in real winter conditions.

**Winter Tire Benefits:**
- Soft rubber compound stays grippy in cold
- Tread pattern channels snow and slush
- Dramatically shorter stopping distances
- Better acceleration and cornering

**Tesla-Specific Considerations:**
- Match load rating to your Tesla's weight (EVs are heavy)
- Consider 18" wheels for better sidewall cushion
- Aero covers fit most 18" winter setups

**Tire Pressure:**
- Check monthly in winter
- Pressure drops ~1 PSI per 5°C temperature drop
- Find recommended PSI on driver's door jamb
- Check when tires are cold (before driving)

After mounting new tires, you may need to [reset your tire pressure monitoring system](/posts/tesla-tire-rotation/).

### 2. Battery & Charging Preparation

Cold batteries charge slower and deliver less range. Here's how to minimize the impact:

**Daily Charging Strategy:**
- Charge to 80-90% daily (not 100%)
- Charge overnight when possible—battery stays warm
- Keep plugged in when parked in extreme cold
- The car uses grid power instead of battery for heating

**Scheduled Departure (Game Changer):**
1. Go to **Controls > Charging > Scheduled Departure**
2. Set your typical departure time
3. The car will:
   - Precondition the battery for optimal range
   - Warm the cabin
   - Finish charging right before you leave

**Before Supercharging:**
- Use navigation to a Supercharger—the car preconditions automatically
- Or manually enable via **Controls > Service > Defrost Car**
- A warm battery charges 2-3x faster than a cold one

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If your <a href="/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/">12V battery</a> is more than 3-4 years old, replace it before winter. Cold weather is when weak 12V batteries fail, potentially leaving you stranded.
</div>

### 3. Door Seals & Handles

Frozen doors are the most common winter Tesla complaint. Prevent them:

**Treat Door Seals:**
1. Clean seals with mild soap and water
2. Apply silicone-based rubber conditioner
3. Wipe off excess
4. Repeat every 1-2 months in winter

**Never use petroleum-based products** (Armor All, WD-40) on rubber seals—they cause cracking.

**Prevent Frozen Door Handles (Model S/X):**
- The presenting handles can freeze in the housing
- Apply silicone spray around the handle mechanism
- Use the Tesla app to preheat—this warms the handles too

**Frozen Charge Port:**
- Common problem in freezing rain
- Use **Defrost Car** from the app to warm the port
- Keep the charge port closed when not charging
- Never force it open—you'll break the latch

For persistent door seal issues, see our [door seal maintenance guide](/posts/tesla-door-seal-maintenance/).

### 4. Wiper Blades & Washer Fluid

**Wiper Blades:**
- Inspect for cracks, tears, or stiff rubber
- Consider winter-specific blades (beam style with rubber covers)
- [Replace if streaking or chattering](/posts/tesla-windshield-wiper-replacement/)

**Washer Fluid:**
- Use winter-rated fluid (rated to -20°C/-40°C)
- Completely drain summer fluid first
- Keep the reservoir full—you'll use a lot

**Before a Snow/Ice Storm:**
- Lift wipers off the windshield overnight
- Prevents freezing to the glass
- Protects wiper motor from strain

### 5. Cabin Air Filter

Cold weather means more time with windows closed. A fresh [cabin air filter](/posts/tesla-cabin-air-filter/) ensures:

- Clean air circulation
- Faster defrosting
- No musty smells
- Efficient HVAC operation

If yours is more than 1-2 years old, replace it before winter.

## Winter Driving Features

### Preconditioning

**From the Tesla App:**
- Tap **Climate** > Turn on heat
- Start 15-30 minutes before driving
- Warms cabin AND battery
- Uses grid power if plugged in (saves range)

**Scheduled Departure:**
- Set it and forget it
- Car is ready exactly when you need it
- More efficient than manual preconditioning

### Defrost Mode

**Controls > Climate > Defrost Car** or app button:
- Blasts heat to windshield and rear window
- Warms side mirrors
- Activates heated seats and steering wheel
- Helps free frozen door handles

### Slip Start

For getting unstuck from snow/ice:

1. Go to **Controls > Dynamics > Slip Start**
2. Reduces traction control intervention
3. Allows wheel spin to dig out
4. Turn off after you're free

### Regen Braking in Winter

You'll notice reduced regen when the battery is cold (dotted lines on the power meter). This is normal:

- Regen returns as battery warms
- One-pedal driving still works, just less aggressively
- Brake earlier since regen is limited
- Consider switching to "Low" regen setting temporarily

If regen seems permanently reduced, see our [regen braking troubleshooting guide](/posts/tesla-regen-braking-reduced/).

## Range Optimization in Cold Weather

Expect 20-40% range loss in winter. Here's how to minimize it:

### Biggest Range Killers

| Factor | Range Impact | Solution |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Cabin heating | 15-25% | Use seat heaters instead |
| Cold battery | 10-20% | Precondition while plugged in |
| Tire rolling resistance | 5-10% | Proper inflation, winter tires |
| Defrosting | 5-10% | Precondition before driving |

### Efficient Winter Driving

**Use Seat Heaters First:**
- Seat heaters use ~75W each
- Cabin heater uses 3,000-6,000W
- Keep cabin at 18-19°C instead of 22°C
- Use heated steering wheel if equipped

**Drive Smoothly:**
- Aggressive acceleration wastes energy
- Regen is limited when cold—coast more
- Keep highway speeds reasonable

**Short Trips Hurt Most:**
- The battery never fully warms up
- Preconditioning helps, but short trips are inefficient
- Combine errands into one trip

For more range optimization tips, see our [range loss fix guide](/posts/tesla-range-loss-fix/).

## Emergency Winter Kit

Keep these in your car during winter:

**Essential Items:**
- Portable jump starter (for helping others, or if 12V dies)
- Ice scraper and snow brush
- Warm blanket
- Flashlight
- Phone charger
- Small shovel
- Traction mats or cat litter (for getting unstuck)

**Optional But Smart:**
- Hand/toe warmers
- High-visibility vest
- First aid kit
- Snacks and water

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Unlike gas cars, you can safely run your Tesla's heater while stationary without carbon monoxide risk. If stranded in a storm, stay in the car with heat on. Monitor battery level and conserve if needed.
</div>

## Model-Specific Tips

### Model 3/Y

- All-wheel drive variants excellent in snow
- RWD models benefit most from winter tires
- Heat pump (2021+) more efficient in cold
- Glass roof rarely has ice issues (steep angle)

### Model S/X

- Air suspension: "High" setting helps in deep snow
- Presenting door handles can freeze—preheat the car
- Falcon wing doors (X): clear snow from roof first
- Older models without heat pump use more energy for heating

### Cybertruck

- Heavy weight + AWD = excellent snow traction
- Watch bed weight distribution
- Cover the bed to prevent snow accumulation

## Pre-Winter Maintenance Checklist

Complete these before cold weather arrives:

- [ ] Inspect/replace wiper blades
- [ ] Fill winter-rated washer fluid
- [ ] Check tire tread depth (3mm+ for winter)

## Charging Infrastructure in Winter

**Home Charging:**
- Keep the car plugged in when parked
- Battery stays warmer, ready to drive
- Scheduled Departure works best when plugged in
- Outdoor charging: keep connector dry, clear snow from port

**Supercharging:**
- Use navigation to precondition battery
- Winter charging is slower than summer
- Plan slightly longer stops
- V3/V4 Superchargers handle cold better than older V2

**Public Charging:**
- CCS/destination chargers also affected by cold
- Expect 20-30% slower charging speeds
- Some stations may have frozen cables
