Every Tesla uses electronic door latches. That means the normal way you open the door — pressing a button or pulling an interior handle — relies on electrical power. In normal operation, this works perfectly. But if your Tesla's 12V battery dies, the car loses power after an accident, or there's an electrical fault, those electronic latches won't respond.

This is where the manual emergency door releases come in. Every Tesla has them, but they're hidden, and their locations vary by model. If you don't know where they are before you need them, you'll be fumbling around in the worst possible moment.

This guide covers every manual door release on every Tesla model. Print it out, bookmark it, or just memorize the locations for your car. This is the kind of thing you want to know before it matters.

## Why Tesla Uses Electronic Door Latches

Before we get into the releases, it's worth understanding why Tesla went with electronic latches in the first place. The answer is mostly aerodynamics and design.

Traditional door handles with mechanical linkages need space, add weight, and create drag. Tesla's flush door handles (especially on Model S and the 2024+ Highland Model 3) contribute to the car's low drag coefficient. Electronic latches also enable features like auto-presenting handles, walk-away locking, and child locks controlled through the touchscreen.

The downside is the power dependency. Every other car manufacturer that uses electronic latches includes mechanical backups too — Tesla is no different. They're just not as obvious about where those backups are.

## Model 3: Front Door Emergency Release

**Pre-2024 (Pre-Highland) Model 3:**

The front doors have a clearly visible mechanical release. It's the physical handle you see on the inside of each front door, just above the electronic open button. You pull it toward you and the door opens mechanically, no power needed.

Here's the important distinction: the **electronic button** on the front door is the one you normally use — it has a small button icon. The **mechanical handle** is the larger lever above it. Many owners don't realize these are two separate mechanisms.

**Tip:** If your 12V battery is dead, use the mechanical lever. It works every time, even with zero power.

**2024+ Highland Model 3:**

The Highland refresh changed the front door mechanism. The interior now has an electronic button release similar to Model S. However, there is still a manual release — it's integrated into the door handle area. Pull the physical lever (not the electronic button) to release the door mechanically.

## Model 3: Rear Door Emergency Release — The Hidden One

This is the release that catches most people off guard. The Model 3's rear doors do **not** have an obvious mechanical release lever. If the car loses power, rear seat passengers — including children — can potentially be trapped.

**Pre-2024 Model 3:**

The manual release is hidden behind the door pocket liner on each rear door. Here's how to access it:

1. **Remove the small rubber mat** from the bottom of the rear door pocket
2. **Peel back the felt liner** inside the door pocket — it's held by clips or adhesive
3. **Look for a small pull tab or cable** — it's typically a white or colored pull strap
4. **Pull the cable firmly** to mechanically release the door latch

This is not intuitive. In an emergency with smoke, water, or panic, finding this release is genuinely difficult. This is why many Model 3 owners retrofit a visible pull strap that extends the hidden cable to an accessible location.

**2024+ Highland Model 3:**

Tesla improved the rear door situation on the Highland refresh. The manual release is more accessible, though still not as obvious as a traditional door handle. Check your specific vehicle's owner's manual for the exact location, as Tesla has revised the mechanism.

## Model Y: Front and Rear Door Emergency Release

**Front Doors:**

Same as the pre-Highland Model 3. There's a clear mechanical handle on each front door interior. Pull it toward you to open the door without power. Simple.

**Rear Doors:**

The Model Y rear doors actually have a visible manual release — a small pull tab near the base of the door, accessible from the rear seat. This is a significant improvement over the Model 3.

On most Model Y vehicles, you'll find a small lever or pull strap near the bottom of the rear door panel. Pull it to release the door mechanically. It's small but it's there.

**Note:** Early Model Y production runs had the same hidden-cable design as Model 3. If you have an early 2020 or 2021 Model Y, check whether your rear doors have a visible pull tab. If not, the release may be hidden behind the door pocket liner, same as Model 3.

## Model S: Front Door Emergency Release

**Pre-2021 Model S (with mechanical door handles):**

The older Model S has traditional pull-type door handles inside. These are fully mechanical — even though the exterior handles are motorized and present automatically, the interior handles work without power. Just pull and the door opens.

**2021+ Model S (Refresh / Plaid):**

The refreshed Model S replaced interior door handles with electronic buttons, similar to what you'd find on the Model 3 Highland. The manual release is a small, recessed lever near the top of the door pocket area. It's not obvious at first glance.

To use it:
1. Locate the small manual release lever near the front of the door panel
2. Pull it firmly toward you
3. The door will release mechanically

Tesla placed this release in a subtle location for aesthetic reasons. Familiarize yourself with it before you need it.

## Model S: Rear Door Emergency Release

The 2021+ Model S rear doors have a manual release similar in concept to the Model 3's — it may require removing a small cover or pulling a hidden lever near the door pocket area.

On pre-2021 Model S, the rear doors have traditional mechanical handles that work without power.

## Model X: Front Door Emergency Release

The Model X front doors operate similarly to the Model S of the same era.

**Pre-2021 Model X:** Interior mechanical handles work without power.

**2021+ Model X (Refresh):** Electronic buttons with a hidden manual release lever, same concept as the refreshed Model S.

## Model X: Falcon Wing Rear Doors — Special Case

The falcon wing doors on Model X are entirely electrically operated. There is no way to manually "wing open" these doors from inside the vehicle. However, Tesla provides an alternative:

**Emergency exit through the falcon wing doors:**
1. There is a manual release near the top of the falcon wing door (accessible from inside)
2. Pull the release — the door will unlatch
3. You'll need to physically push the door open, which requires some force since the power struts won't assist

**Important:** In some failure modes, the falcon wing doors may not open at all due to the complex hinge mechanism. In this case, rear passengers should:
- Exit through the front doors if possible
- Use the front seats to climb forward
- As a last resort, the rear windshield can be broken with an emergency tool

This is why keeping a window breaker tool accessible in a Model X is genuinely good advice, not just paranoia.

## Cybertruck Emergency Door Release

The Cybertruck uses electronic buttons for all four doors. Manual releases are present but their locations differ from the sedan/SUV models.

**Front doors:** A manual release lever is located on the interior door panel, similar in concept to the 2021+ Model S/X.

**Rear doors:** Manual releases are present — check the area near the door pocket or base of the door panel.

Given the Cybertruck's unique construction, familiarize yourself with these locations during your first week of ownership.

## The Frunk and Trunk

**Frunk (Front Trunk):**

If the car has no power, the frunk cannot be opened from inside the vehicle — there's no release mechanism for it from the cabin. However, the frunk can be opened externally by:

1. Connecting a jump pack or external 12V power source to the jump posts (located behind the tow hook cover on most models)
2. This powers the frunk latch electronically

**Trunk / Liftgate:**

The Model 3 trunk has an interior emergency release (the glow-in-the-dark pull handle inside the trunk). This is required by law for any vehicle with a trunk that could trap someone.

The Model Y, S, and X liftgates/hatchbacks don't have this issue since they open to the cabin area, but they do have manual release mechanisms accessible from the cargo area.

## 12V Battery Dead: How to Get In From Outside

If your 12V battery dies and you can't get into the car at all:

**Model 3 and Model Y:**
1. The key card still works — tap it on the B-pillar
2. If that doesn't respond, you need to jump the 12V system
3. On Model 3: Remove the tow hook cover on the front bumper to access the jump posts
4. Connect a portable jump starter or another car's battery to the jump posts
5. The car will power up enough to unlock the doors

**Model S and Model X:**
1. The key fob should still work for unlocking if the 12V has some charge
2. If completely dead, access the jump posts (location varies by year) and provide external 12V power

**Pro tip:** Keep a compact jump starter in your garage, not in the car. If it's in the car and the car won't open, it doesn't help you.

## Teach Your Passengers

This is the most important section. You probably know how your Tesla works because you drive it every day. Your passengers don't.

**Before their first ride, show every passenger:**
1. How to open the door normally (the electronic button)
2. Where the mechanical release is (the manual lever/handle)
3. For rear passengers: where the emergency release is located

This takes 30 seconds and could prevent panic in an emergency. Children especially should know this — they may not have the presence of mind to figure it out under stress.

## Retrofitting Visible Rear Emergency Releases

For Model 3 owners concerned about the hidden rear door cable, aftermarket companies sell retrofit kits that extend the emergency release cable to a visible, accessible pull strap. These typically:

- Attach to the existing emergency cable
- Route through or around the door pocket
- Provide a brightly colored pull tab that's always visible
- Install in about 15-20 minutes per door with basic trim tools

This is a worthwhile upgrade if you regularly carry rear passengers, especially children or elderly family members who might not know about the hidden release.

## When Emergency Releases Won't Work

In extreme cases — severe accidents with structural deformation — even mechanical releases may not open a door if the frame is bent. In these situations:

1. **Try all four doors** — damage is usually concentrated on one side
2. **Try the windows** — Tesla windows can sometimes be lowered even with low power
3. **Break a side window** — tempered glass will shatter safely into small pieces. Use a window breaker tool aimed at the corner of the glass, not the center
4. **Do NOT try to break the windshield or rear glass** — these are laminated and extremely difficult to break through

## Key Takeaways

- **Front doors** on all Teslas have accessible manual releases — learn which lever/handle it is
- **Rear doors** are the problem area, especially on Model 3 where the release is hidden
- **Model X falcon wing doors** are the most complex — have a backup plan
- **Teach every passenger** where the releases are before driving
- **Keep a window breaker** in an accessible spot, especially in Model X
- **A dead 12V battery** is the most common scenario for needing these — keep a jump starter handy

Your Tesla is an incredibly safe car. The manual door releases are a backup system you'll probably never need. But "probably" isn't "never," and knowing where they are takes five minutes of your time. That's a worthwhile investment.
