Tesla doesn't include gear oil changes in their standard maintenance schedule, but that doesn't mean the fluid lasts forever. The reduction gear in your Tesla's drive unit relies on oil to lubricate the gears and bearings. Over time, this oil breaks down and collects metal particles from normal wear.

## Why Change Tesla Gear Oil?

**Benefits of Fresh Gear Oil:**
- Reduced wear on gears and bearings
- Quieter operation
- Better efficiency (slightly)
- Extended drive unit lifespan
- Peace of mind for high-mileage owners

**Signs Your Gear Oil May Need Changing:**
- Whining or humming from drive unit
- Noise increases with speed
- Car has 50,000+ miles
- Previous owner's maintenance unknown

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Prevention vs Repair:</strong> A gear oil change costs $100-200 DIY. A drive unit replacement costs $5,000-15,000. Regular fluid maintenance is cheap insurance.
</div>

## Tesla Gear Oil Specifications

Tesla uses Pentosin FFL-4 (or equivalent) in their drive units:

**Specifications:**
- **Type:** Full synthetic gear oil
- **Viscosity:** 75W (at operating temperature)
- **Standard:** Meets VW G 052 178 A2

**Capacity by Model:**

| Model | Front Drive Unit | Rear Drive Unit |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Model 3 RWD | N/A | 590ml |
| Model 3 AWD | 530ml | 590ml |
| Model Y RWD | N/A | 590ml |
| Model Y AWD | 530ml | 590ml |
| Model S/X | 450ml | 590ml |

**Important:** Quantities vary slightly by production date. Always fill until fluid reaches the fill plug level.

## DIY Gear Oil Change Guide

### Safety First

- Work on level ground
- Use proper jack stands (never rely on a jack alone)
- Allow car to cool if recently driven
- Wear gloves and eye protection

### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle

1. Park on level ground
2. Put car in Park and enable "Jack Mode" (Controls > Service > Jack Mode)
3. Lift the car and secure on jack stands
4. Remove aerodynamic underbody panels as needed

### Step 2: Locate Drain and Fill Plugs

**Rear Drive Unit:**
- Drain plug: Bottom of drive unit housing (14mm hex)
- Fill plug: Side of drive unit, slightly higher (10mm hex)

**Front Drive Unit (AWD models):**
- Same arrangement but smaller unit
- Located behind front subframe

### Step 3: Drain Old Fluid

1. Place drain pan under drive unit
2. Remove the **fill plug first** (breaks vacuum, allows complete drain)
3. Remove the **drain plug**
4. Allow fluid to drain completely (5-10 minutes)
5. Inspect drained fluid for metal particles

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>What to Look For:</strong> Some fine metal dust is normal. Large particles or chunks indicate potential problems—consider having the drive unit inspected.
</div>

### Step 4: Replace Drain Plug

1. Clean drain plug threads
2. Install new crush washer (recommended)
3. Reinstall drain plug
4. Torque to specification: 25 Nm (18 ft-lb)

### Step 5: Fill With New Fluid

1. Using a fluid transfer pump, add new gear oil through fill plug
2. Fill slowly until fluid begins to seep from fill hole
3. This indicates the correct level
4. Allow excess to drip out

### Step 6: Replace Fill Plug

1. Clean fill plug threads
2. Install new crush washer
3. Reinstall fill plug
4. Torque to specification: 15 Nm (11 ft-lb)

### Step 7: Repeat for Front Drive Unit (AWD)

Same process for front unit if equipped.

### Step 8: Test Drive

1. Lower car and disable Jack Mode
2. Drive for 10-15 minutes
3. Listen for any unusual noises
4. Recheck plugs for leaks after driving

## Recommended Change Intervals

Tesla doesn't specify an interval, but experienced owners recommend:

| Usage | Interval |
|-------|----------|
| Normal driving | Every 50,000 miles / 80,000 km |
| High performance driving | Every 30,000 miles / 50,000 km |
| Track use | Every 15,000 miles / 25,000 km |
| After any drive unit service | Immediately |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Removing drain plug first** - Always remove fill plug first to break vacuum
2. **Wrong fluid type** - Only use approved gear oil (not motor oil)
3. **Overfilling** - Fill only until fluid seeps from fill hole
4. **Reusing crush washers** - New washers ensure proper seal
5. **Skipping torque specs** - Over-tightening can strip soft aluminum

## What About the "Lifetime" Fluid Claim?

Tesla calls their gear oil "lifetime fill," but this is marketing, not engineering:

- **What "lifetime" means:** Expected to last the warranty period
- **What it doesn't mean:** Optimal for entire vehicle life
- **Reality:** Fluid degrades over time and miles

Many Tesla owners with 100,000+ trouble-free miles credit regular gear oil changes for their drive unit longevity.

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $80-150 | $150-250 | $230-400 |
| Independent Shop | $80-150 | $100-150 | $180-300 |
| DIY | $50-100 | Free | $50-100 |

**Parts Needed for DIY:**
- Pentosin FFL-4 (1-2 liters): $40-80
- Crush washers (4x): $5-10
- Fluid pump (one-time): $20-30

## Pro Tips

**Warming the Fluid:**
Drive for 10 minutes before draining. Warm fluid flows better and carries more contaminants out.

**Keep a Sample:**
Save some old fluid in a clear container. This provides a baseline for future changes and can indicate developing problems.

**Check Magnet:**
Some drain plugs are magnetic. Examine for metal particles—fine dust is normal, chunks are not.

**Label Your Fluids:**
Front and rear units take the same fluid, but keep track of how much goes in each.

*Gear oil changes are one of the most overlooked Tesla maintenance items. It's a straightforward job that can add years to your drive unit's life. If you can change oil in a gas car, you can do this.*
