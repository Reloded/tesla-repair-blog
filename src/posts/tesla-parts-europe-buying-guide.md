Finding Tesla parts in Europe used to be a nightmare. Tesla Service Centers were often the only option, with long wait times and premium prices. That's changed. Today, you have multiple options depending on what you need, your budget, and how quickly you need it.

This guide breaks down where to buy Tesla parts in Europe, with honest pros and cons for each option.

## Quick Summary

| Source | Best For | Price | Shipping | Availability |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Tesla Service | Warranty work, complex parts | $$$ | Varies | Limited stock |
| Tesla Online Shop | Accessories, simple parts | $$ | 1-2 weeks | Good |
| RR Car Parts | OEM parts, used parts, EU shipping | $-$$ | 2-5 days EU | 8000+ parts |
| Amazon.de | Tools, consumables, accessories | $-$$ | 1-3 days Prime | Variable |
| eBay | Used/salvage parts | $ | Varies | Hit or miss |

## Option 1: Tesla Service Centers

**Best for:** Warranty repairs, complex parts, when you need Tesla to do the work anyway

Tesla's official service centers can order any part, but the experience varies:

**Pros:**
- Guaranteed genuine OEM parts
- Warranty coverage on repairs
- They handle everything

**Cons:**
- Expensive labor rates (€150-200/hour)
- Parts markup can be significant
- Appointments often 2-4 weeks out
- Some parts backordered for months
- Can't always buy parts without booking service

**When to use:** If your car is under warranty, or you need a complex part that requires programming (like a new MCU or drive unit), go through Tesla.

## Option 2: Tesla Online Shop

Tesla has an official parts shop at [shop.tesla.com](https://shop.tesla.com), though availability varies by country.

**Available parts typically include:**
- Cabin air filters
- Wiper blades
- Key fobs and key cards
- Wheel accessories
- Touch-up paint
- Basic accessories

**Pros:**
- Genuine Tesla parts
- No appointment needed
- Reasonable prices for accessories

**Cons:**
- Limited selection (mostly consumables)
- No mechanical parts
- Shipping can be slow
- Often out of stock

**When to use:** Good for routine maintenance items like [cabin air filters](/posts/tesla-cabin-air-filter/) or [wiper blades](/posts/tesla-windshield-wiper-replacement/) if you want genuine Tesla parts.

## Option 3: Specialized Tesla Parts Suppliers

This is where European Tesla owners have a real advantage now. Several suppliers specialize in Tesla parts and ship across Europe.

### RR Car Parts (Lithuania)

[RR Car Parts](https://rrcarparts.com) stocks over 8,000 Tesla parts and ships across Europe. They carry:

- **OEM parts** - Genuine Tesla components
- **Aftermarket parts** - Quality alternatives at lower prices
- **Used/salvage parts** - Tested parts from salvage vehicles at significant savings

**Parts categories:**
- 12V and 16V batteries
- Suspension components (control arms, ball joints, bushings)
- Body panels and trim
- Electrical components
- Interior parts (seats, trim, covers)
- Wheels and covers

**Pros:**
- Large EU-based inventory
- Ships across Europe (2-5 days typical)
- Mix of new, OEM, and used options
- Competitive pricing
- Pre-orders available for out-of-stock items

**Cons:**
- Some parts may be used/salvage (clearly labeled)
- Not every part available

**Full disclosure:** I work at RR Car Parts, so I know the inventory well. That said, I genuinely recommend them because I've seen the quality control firsthand.

**When to use:** Great for [12V battery replacement](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/), [suspension repairs](/posts/tesla-suspension-noise-fix/), body work, or when you want OEM quality without Tesla Service Center prices.

### Other EU Suppliers

- **EV Parts EU** (Netherlands) - Focuses on EV-specific components
- **Greentech Factory** (Germany) - Some Tesla parts alongside other EVs
- **Local salvage yards** - Worth checking for body panels and glass

## Option 4: Amazon (DE/UK/etc.)

Amazon is useful for certain Tesla parts, especially tools and consumables.

**Good for:**
- Tools (socket sets, torque wrenches, pry tools)
- Consumables (brake cleaner, grease, electrical contact cleaner)
- Aftermarket accessories (floor mats, screen protectors)
- Generic parts (cabin air filters, wiper blades)
- [USB drives for dashcam/Sentry](/posts/tesla-dashcam-usb-setup/)

**Not recommended for:**
- Critical mechanical parts
- Electrical components
- Anything safety-related

**Pros:**
- Fast Prime shipping
- Easy returns
- Good for tools

**Cons:**
- Quality varies wildly
- Many counterfeit/low-quality parts
- Hard to verify compatibility

**When to use:** Buy your tools from Amazon. For actual Tesla parts, be very careful—stick to known brands or use Amazon as a last resort for consumables only.

## Option 5: eBay and Online Marketplaces

eBay can be a source for used Tesla parts, but requires caution.

**Pros:**
- Sometimes the only source for rare parts
- Prices can be very low
- Buyer protection available

**Cons:**
- Quality varies enormously
- Shipping from US/China can take weeks
- Risk of damaged or incorrect parts
- Harder to return

**Tips for buying on eBay:**
- Check seller ratings and history
- Look for detailed photos
- Verify part numbers match your vehicle
- Factor in customs/VAT for non-EU sellers
- Avoid "too good to be true" prices

## OEM vs. Aftermarket vs. Used: What to Choose?

### Go OEM When:
- Safety-critical components (brakes, suspension bolts)
- Electrical/electronic parts
- Under warranty
- Part failure could strand you

### Aftermarket is Fine For:
- Cabin air filters
- Wiper blades
- Wheel accessories
- Interior trim pieces
- Touch-up paint

### Used Parts Work For:
- Body panels (check for damage)
- Interior trim
- Non-safety suspension components
- Cosmetic parts
- Expensive parts where OEM is overkill

## Part Numbers: How to Find Them

Before ordering, get the correct part number. Tesla uses specific part numbers that vary by model year and configuration.

**How to find your part number:**
1. **Tesla Service Manual** - If you have access
2. **Ask Tesla Service** - They can look it up
3. **Online parts catalogs** - Several sites list Tesla part numbers
4. **Salvage listings** - Often include part numbers

**Example part number format:** `1044691-00-B` (Model 3 front lower control arm)

Always verify the part number matches your specific vehicle before ordering.

## Shipping and Customs in the EU

**Within the EU:**
- No customs duties
- VAT included in price
- Typical shipping 2-5 days

**From UK (post-Brexit):**
- Customs may apply on orders over €150
- VAT charged on import
- Longer shipping times
- Can still be worth it for rare parts

**From US/China:**
- Import duties + VAT
- Shipping 2-4 weeks
- Customs clearance delays possible
- Only use for parts unavailable in EU

## Final Thoughts

The days of Tesla being the only option for parts are over. For most DIY repairs covered on this site, you can find quality parts at reasonable prices from European suppliers.

Start with the part number, compare prices across a few sources, and don't automatically assume Amazon is cheapest—specialized suppliers often beat them on actual Tesla parts while offering better quality assurance.
