# Tesla Wheel Bearing Replacement: DIY Guide

Hearing a humming, droning, or growling noise that gets louder with speed? It might be a worn wheel bearing. Tesla uses hub-style wheel bearings on all models, making replacement relatively straightforward compared to press-in bearings — if you have the right tools.

## Symptoms of a Bad Wheel Bearing

**Classic signs:**
- Humming or droning noise that increases with speed
- Noise changes when turning (gets louder in one direction, quieter in the other)
- Vibration felt through the steering wheel or floor
- Play or looseness when rocking the wheel (with car jacked up)
- ABS or traction control warnings (failing encoder ring)

**The turn test:** If the noise gets louder when turning left, the *right* bearing is likely bad (and vice versa). Turning loads weight onto the opposite side.

## Tesla Wheel Bearing Design

All Tesla models use **hub assembly units** — the bearing is integrated into a hub that bolts to the steering knuckle. This design is DIY-friendly because:

- No press required (just bolts)
- Bearing, hub, and ABS encoder are one unit
- Four bolts to the knuckle, one axle nut

**Key detail:** Tesla hub units have a **magnetic encoder ring** on the back for the ABS/traction control sensors. Metallic debris can stick to this ring and cause sensor issues. Always inspect and clean before installing.

## Which Bearing Do You Need?

Tesla uses different hub assemblies for front and rear, and between single/dual motor variants:

| Model | Position | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Model 3/Y RWD | Rear only driven | Front bearings smaller |
| Model 3/Y AWD | Front + Rear driven | Larger front bearings |
| Model S/X | All similar design | Larger/heavier duty |

> **Part tip:** Front left and right are often different part numbers due to encoder ring orientation. Rears are typically interchangeable left/right.

Check the tools list above for OEM Tesla hub assemblies from RR Car Parts.

### Aftermarket Options

Quality aftermarket bearings from SKF, FAG, or Timken work well and cost 30-50% less than OEM. Search for your specific model's hub assembly on Amazon.

## Tools Required

**Essential:**
- Socket set (metric: 10mm, 13mm, 17mm, 18mm, 21mm)
- Torque wrench (capable of 200+ Nm)
- Axle nut socket (36mm for most Teslas)
- Breaker bar (axle nut is TIGHT — 250-350 Nm)
- Jack and jack stands
- Pry bar
- Rubber mallet
- Penetrating oil (PB Blaster or similar)

**Highly recommended:**
- Impact wrench (makes axle nut much easier)
- Hub removal tool / slide hammer (if stuck)
- Torque angle gauge (some bolts spec'd in degrees)

See the tools list above for recommended sockets and torque wrenches.

## Step-by-Step Replacement

This guide covers a front wheel bearing on Model 3/Y. Rear procedure is similar but simpler (no steering components).

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Loosen the axle nut while car is on the ground (it's VERY tight)
2. Loosen wheel lug nuts
3. Jack up the car and secure on jack stands
4. Remove the wheel
5. Spray all bolts with penetrating oil — let it soak

> **⚠️ Important:** Never work under a car supported only by a jack. Always use jack stands.

### Step 2: Remove the Brake Caliper

1. Remove the two caliper bracket bolts (18mm typically)
2. Hang the caliper with wire or a bungee — don't let it hang by the brake hose
3. Remove the brake rotor (may need to back off parking brake adjuster on rear)

### Step 3: Disconnect the ABS Sensor

1. Locate the ABS sensor wiring connector on the knuckle
2. Unclip and disconnect it
3. Remove any clips holding the wire to the suspension

### Step 4: Remove the Axle Nut

1. Fully remove the axle nut (36mm)
2. If the axle spins, have someone press the brake pedal or use a pry bar
3. The nut may have a cotter pin or staking — remove/straighten first

### Step 5: Separate the Lower Ball Joint (Front Only)

1. Remove the pinch bolt from the lower control arm ball joint
2. Use a pry bar to separate the knuckle from the ball joint
3. Be careful not to damage the ball joint boot

### Step 6: Push the Axle Through the Hub

1. Use a rubber mallet or brass punch to push the axle shaft back through the hub
2. If stuck, thread the axle nut on a few turns to protect the threads while hammering
3. The axle needs to be free of the hub splines to remove the hub

### Step 7: Remove the Hub Assembly

1. Remove the four bolts holding the hub to the knuckle (typically 13mm or 17mm)
2. The hub should slide off the knuckle
3. If stuck, use a hub puller or slide hammer
4. **Inspect the encoder ring** — clean any metallic debris with a plastic brush

### Step 8: Install the New Hub

1. Clean the knuckle mounting surface
2. Position the new hub assembly, aligning the bolt holes
3. Install and hand-tighten the four hub bolts
4. Torque the hub bolts to spec:
   - **Model 3/Y:** 85 Nm (62.7 ft-lb)
   - **Model S/X:** Check service manual for your year

### Step 9: Reassemble

1. Push the axle back through the hub splines
2. Install the axle nut and torque to spec:
   - **Model 3/Y:** 300 Nm (221 ft-lb)
   - **Model S/X:** Check service manual for your year
3. Stake the axle nut or install new cotter pin
4. Reconnect the ball joint and install pinch bolt — 55 Nm
5. Reconnect the ABS sensor
6. Install the rotor and caliper
7. Install the wheel and torque lug nuts — 175 Nm (129 ft-lb)

### Step 10: Test

1. Lower the car
2. Before driving, pump the brake pedal several times to reseat the pads
3. Test drive at low speed first, listening for any new noises
4. The ABS light should clear on its own; if not, a short drive usually resets it

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service | $200-350 | $200-400 | **$400-750** per corner |
| Indie Shop + OEM | $150-250 | $100-200 | **$250-450** per corner |
| DIY + Aftermarket | $80-150 | $0 | **$80-150** per corner |

## Tips from Experience

**1. Don't skip the penetrating oil.** Spray everything the night before if possible. Tesla bolts love to seize.

**2. The axle nut is no joke.** 290+ Nm requires serious torque. An impact wrench saves significant effort. If you're using a breaker bar, brace the car well.

**3. Check the other side.** Wheel bearings often fail in pairs. If one is bad, the other is probably not far behind.

**4. Inspect while you're in there:**
- Ball joint boots
- CV axle boots
- Brake pads and rotors
- Suspension bushings

**5. Re-torque after 50-100 miles.** Some technicians recommend rechecking the axle nut torque after initial break-in.

## When to Call a Pro

While this job is DIY-able, consider professional help if:
- You don't have an impact wrench (the axle nut is brutal by hand)
- The hub is seized to the knuckle (may need a shop press)
- You're not comfortable with suspension work
- You need an alignment afterward (recommended but not always required)
