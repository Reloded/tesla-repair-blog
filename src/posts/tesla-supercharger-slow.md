Arriving at a Supercharger expecting fast charging, only to see speeds well below what you anticipated, is frustrating. Before blaming the charger or your car, understand that many factors affect Supercharging speed. Most "slow" charging situations are actually normal behavior based on conditions.

## Understanding Tesla Charge Curves

Tesla batteries don't charge at a constant rate. The charging speed follows a curve:

- **0-20% state of charge:** Moderate speed (battery not warm yet)
- **20-50% state of charge:** Peak charging speed
- **50-80% state of charge:** Gradually decreasing speed
- **80-100% state of charge:** Significantly slower (cell balancing)

This is why Tesla recommends charging to 80% for road trips—the last 20% takes almost as long as the first 80%.

## Why Your Supercharging Might Be Slow

### 1. Cold Battery (Most Common)

Cold batteries charge slowly to prevent damage:

- Below 10°C: Charging limited to 50-75 kW
- Below 0°C: May be limited to 25-50 kW
- Optimal temperature: 25-35°C for peak speeds

**Solution: Precondition Your Battery**

1. Set your Supercharger as a navigation destination
2. The car automatically warms the battery en route
3. Start preconditioning 30-45 minutes before arrival
4. Look for the snowflake icon to disappear from the battery indicator

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you know where the Supercharger is, use navigation. This triggers automatic preconditioning that significantly improves charging speed.

### 2. Hot Battery

Extreme heat also limits charging:

- After aggressive driving or track use
- In hot climates (40°C+)
- The car reduces speed to protect battery longevity

**Solution:** Park in shade before charging if possible, or drive moderately the last few kilometers before charging.

### 3. Power Sharing at Busy Stations

At V2 Superchargers, two stalls share one power cabinet:

- Stalls are labeled A and B (e.g., 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B)
- If 1A is occupied, 1B shares the power
- Both cars get reduced speeds

**Solution:** At V2 stations, choose a stall where the paired letter is empty (if 1A is taken, use 2A instead of 1B).

V3 Superchargers don't have this limitation—each stall has dedicated power up to 250 kW.

### 4. High State of Charge

Starting a charging session above 80% results in slow speeds:

- 80-90%: Charging drops to 30-50 kW
- 90-100%: May be as low as 10-20 kW

**Solution:** Arrive at Superchargers with 10-20% charge for fastest overall experience.

### 5. Battery Degradation

Older batteries with significant degradation may charge slightly slower:

- Typically noticeable after 200,000+ km
- Usually 5-15% reduction in peak speeds
- Not a sudden change—gradual over time

### 6. Supercharger Hardware Issues

Sometimes the charger itself has problems:

- One stall may have a fault
- Cables can have reduced capacity
- Station may have grid power limitations

**Solution:** Try a different stall. If all stalls are slow, the station may have issues—report via the Tesla app.

## Expected Charging Speeds by Model

Peak speeds under ideal conditions:

| Model | V2 Supercharger | V3 Supercharger |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Model 3 LR | 150-170 kW | 250 kW |
| Model 3 SR | 150-170 kW | 170 kW |
| Model Y LR | 150-170 kW | 250 kW |
| Model S (2021+) | 150 kW | 250 kW |
| Model X (2021+) | 150 kW | 250 kW |

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> These are peak speeds achieved briefly at optimal state of charge and temperature. Average speeds across a full session will be lower.
</div>

## How to Maximize Supercharging Speed

### Before Your Trip
1. Check battery temperature (warmer is better)
2. Plan to arrive at 10-20% state of charge
3. Use Tesla navigation for preconditioning

### Choosing a Stall
1. Look for V3 Superchargers (250 kW) when possible
2. At V2 stations, check for paired stalls
3. Avoid end stalls which sometimes have cable issues

### During Charging
1. Keep climate control running (helps battery thermal management)
2. Don't set a charge limit above 80% unless necessary
3. Leave when you have enough charge—don't wait for 100%

### Monitor Your Session
In the Tesla app:
- Current charging power (kW)
- Time remaining to target
- Energy added (kWh)

## When to Contact Tesla Service

- Charging consistently 50%+ slower than expected
- Error messages during Supercharging sessions
- Charging stops unexpectedly before reaching target
- Unusual battery warnings appear

## The 80% Rule for Road Trips

For optimal trip times:
1. Charge to 80-90% at each stop
2. Drive to 10-20% before the next Supercharger
3. This keeps you in the "fast charging zone"
4. Multiple shorter sessions beat one long session
