The Tesla Model S uses an electric parking brake system with a small motor integrated into each rear caliper. When this motor fails, you'll get parking brake errors, the car may not shift out of Park, or the parking brake may not engage at all. Tesla service centers charge **€800-1,200+** for this repair, but with a salvage caliper motor, you can fix it yourself for under €200.

## Symptoms of a Failed Caliper Motor

- "Parking Brake Unavailable" error message
- "Car May Roll" warning
- Parking brake won't engage or release
- Clicking/grinding sound from rear brakes
- Car stuck in Park

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety First:</strong> If your parking brake is stuck engaged, do not attempt to drive the car. You can damage the brake system and create a dangerous situation.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Parts:**
- Replacement rear caliper motor (left or right, match your failed side)
- Source: Tesla salvage, eBay, or pull from a complete salvage caliper

**Expected Cost:**
- Tesla Service Center: €800-1,200+
- DIY with salvage motor: €100-200

**Tools:**
- Floor jack and jack stands
- 18mm socket (wheel bolts)
- T40 Torx socket (caliper bolts)
- Brake caliper piston tool (or large adjustable pliers)
- Torque wrench
- Electrical connector release tool (or small flathead)
- Clean rags

## Understanding the Caliper Motor

The caliper motor is a small electric actuator mounted on the rear of the brake caliper. It's responsible for:
- Engaging the parking brake by pressing the piston against the rotor
- Releasing the parking brake when you shift out of Park
- Auto-hold function at traffic lights

The motor can be replaced separately without replacing the entire caliper, though some choose to swap the complete caliper assembly if sourcing is easier.

## Step-by-Step Replacement

### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle

1. Park on a flat, level surface
2. Put the car in "Tow Mode" if possible (Controls > Service > Tow Mode)
3. This disables the parking brake to make the job easier
4. If the parking brake is stuck, you may need to manually release it

### Step 2: Lift and Secure the Vehicle

1. Loosen the rear wheel bolts while the car is on the ground
2. Jack up the rear of the car
3. Place jack stands under the proper lift points
4. Remove the wheel

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Tesla recommends specific jack points to avoid damaging the battery. Check your owner's manual for the correct locations.
</div>

### Step 3: Access the Caliper Motor

1. Locate the rear brake caliper
2. The motor is the cylindrical component on the back of the caliper
3. Identify the electrical connector going to the motor

### Step 4: Disconnect the Motor

1. Locate the electrical connector on the caliper motor
2. Press the release tab and gently pull the connector apart
3. If the connector is stuck, use a small flathead to help release the tab
4. Do not pull on the wires

### Step 5: Remove the Caliper Motor

The motor is typically held in place by a retaining ring or bolts:

**Retaining ring type:**
1. Use snap ring pliers to remove the retaining ring
2. Twist and pull the motor straight out

**Bolt-on type:**
1. Remove the T40 Torx bolts securing the motor
2. Pull the motor straight out of the caliper

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Note the position of the motor before removal. It must be installed in the same orientation.
</div>

### Step 6: Prepare the New Motor

1. Compare the old and new motors — they should be identical
2. Check that any O-rings or seals are in place
3. Apply a thin layer of brake grease to the seal if included

### Step 7: Install the New Motor

1. Align the new motor with the caliper housing
2. Push the motor in while rotating slightly if needed
3. Reinstall the retaining ring or bolts
4. Ensure the motor is fully seated

### Step 8: Reconnect and Test

1. Plug in the electrical connector until it clicks
2. Reinstall the wheel and lower the car
3. Torque wheel bolts to 175 Nm (129 ft-lb)
4. Turn on the car and test the parking brake

## Calibration After Replacement

The car may need to recalibrate the parking brake:

1. Go to **Controls > Service > Brakes**
2. Select **Calibrate Parking Brake** if available
3. The system will cycle the parking brake several times
4. Clear any error codes that may be stored

If calibration isn't available in your menu, try:
1. Turn off the car completely
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Turn back on
4. The system should auto-calibrate on first use

## Troubleshooting

**Motor doesn't work after replacement:**
- Double-check the electrical connection
- Verify you have the correct motor (left vs right can differ)
- Try a soft reboot (hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds)

**Parking brake still gives errors:**
- The caliper piston may need to be reset
- Use a brake piston tool to fully retract and extend the piston
- Recalibrate through the service menu

**Clicking sounds after installation:**
- Motor may not be fully seated
- Remove and reinstall, ensuring proper alignment

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | €800-1,200+ | Includes diagnosis |
| DIY with salvage motor | €100-200 | About 1-2 hours work |
| DIY with complete caliper | €200-400 | Easier but more expensive |

## Where to Find Parts

- **Tesla salvage specialists** — Often have individual motors pulled from calipers
- **eBay** — Search "Tesla Model S rear caliper motor" or "parking brake actuator"
- **Car-Part.com** — Junkyard inventory search (may need complete caliper)
- **Tesla forums** — TMC marketplace often has parts for sale

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Buying tip:</strong> If you can only find complete rear calipers, you can buy one and extract the motor yourself. This also gives you spare brake pads and hardware.
