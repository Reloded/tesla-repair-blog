Tesla's minimalist interior looks great but can develop annoying rattles and creaks over time. The good news? Most are easy DIY fixes with inexpensive materials. Here's how to hunt down and eliminate those noises.

## Identifying the Source

Before fixing, you need to locate the noise. Use these techniques:

**Passenger Test:**
Have someone ride along and point to where they hear the noise. Driver focus makes it hard to pinpoint sounds.

**Speed and Surface:**
- Does it happen at certain speeds?
- Only on rough roads?
- During acceleration or braking?

**Temperature:**
- Worse when cold or hot?
- Temperature-sensitive noises are often plastic-on-plastic

**The Knock Test:**
With the car parked, tap on panels and trim pieces to see if you can recreate the rattle.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Record the noise on your phone and play it back. This helps identify the frequency and pattern.
</div>

## Common Rattle Locations and Fixes

### Dashboard and Center Console

**Symptom:** Rattles from the dash area, especially over bumps.

**Cause:** Loose trim pieces, cables hitting panels, or poor clips.

**Fix:**
1. Remove affected trim panels with plastic pry tools
2. Apply felt tape to contact points between panels
3. Secure any loose cables with zip ties
4. Add foam tape behind panels for cushioning
5. Reinstall, ensuring all clips fully engage

**Common Dash Rattle Spots:**
- Behind the main screen
- A/C vent bezels
- Upper dash trim near windshield
- Center console armrest

### Door Panel Rattles

**Symptom:** Rattles from doors, especially with bass-heavy music.

**Cause:** Loose speaker mounting, window regulator cables, or vapor barrier.

**Fix:**
1. Remove door panel (clips + screws)
2. Tighten speaker mounting screws
3. Apply foam tape around speaker
4. Check vapor barrier is sealed
5. Secure any loose window cables
6. Reinstall panel, checking all clips

### Seat Rattles

**Symptom:** Noise from seat area, changes with passenger weight.

**Cause:** Loose seat bolts, items under seat, seat track debris.

**Fix:**
1. Check for objects under seats (coins, chargers, etc.)
2. Verify seat mounting bolts are tight (front and rear)
3. Clean seat tracks with vacuum
4. Lubricate seat rails with silicone spray
5. Check powered seat motor mounts

### Rear Parcel Shelf (Model 3/Y)

**Symptom:** Rattling from behind rear seats.

**Cause:** Parcel shelf not seated properly, loose rear deck items.

**Fix:**
1. Remove parcel shelf
2. Add felt pads to mounting points
3. Check nothing is loose underneath
4. Reinstall firmly in clips

### Glass Roof Creaks

**Symptom:** Creaking from roof, especially in temperature changes.

**Cause:** Glass expanding/contracting against seals.

**Fix:**
1. Apply silicone lubricant to roof seal edges
2. Don't use petroleum-based products (damages rubber)
3. Some noise is normal with large glass panels

### Seatbelt Rattle

**Symptom:** Seatbelt hardware rattles against trim.

**Cause:** B-pillar trim loose, or seatbelt retractor worn.

**Fix:**
1. Check B-pillar trim is fully clipped
2. Add felt tape where belt contacts trim
3. If retractor rattles, may need service

## Suspension Creaks and Squeaks

### Front Suspension Squeak

**Symptom:** Squeak over bumps, especially when cold.

**Cause:** Likely upper [control arm](/posts/tesla-control-arm-replacement/) ball joints.

**Quick Fix:**
- Apply silicone spray to ball joint boot
- Temporary solution until replacement

### Rear Suspension Clunk

**Symptom:** Clunk from rear when starting or stopping.

**Cause:** Subframe bushings, rear motor mounts (AWD), or trailing arm bushings.

**Fix:**
- Inspect bushings for cracks
- Tighten all suspension bolts to spec
- May require professional service for bushing replacement

### Steering Column Creak

**Symptom:** Creak when turning wheel, especially at slow speeds.

**Cause:** Steering column adjustment mechanism or flexible coupling.

**Fix:**
1. Adjust steering wheel position
2. Apply silicone to adjustment lever mechanism
3. If persistent, schedule service (steering is safety-critical)

## Universal Rattle-Proofing Materials

Keep these on hand for rattle hunting:

**Felt Tape:**
- Best for panel-to-panel contact
- Prevents plastic-on-plastic squeaks
- Apply to clips and mounting points

**Foam Weatherstrip:**
- Fills larger gaps
- Cushions vibrations
- Great behind panels and trim

**Silicone Lubricant:**
- For rubber seals and hinges
- Won't damage plastic or rubber
- Temporary fix for many squeaks

**Zip Ties/Cable Ties:**
- Secure loose wiring
- Bundle cables together
- Prevent wires from hitting panels

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Never use WD-40 on interior parts!</strong> It attracts dust and can damage plastics. Use silicone-based lubricants only.
</div>

## Tesla Service vs DIY

**When to DIY:**
- Intermittent interior rattles
- Clearly identified loose trim
- Noise from non-safety components

**When to Visit Service:**
- Suspension noises (may be safety-related)
- Steering noises
- Noise you can't locate after thorough search
- Under warranty and want documentation

## The Tesla Rattle Kit

Build your own rattle-fighting kit:

| Item | Use | Cost |
|------|-----|------|
| Felt tape roll | Panel contact points | $10 |
| Foam tape (various thickness) | Gap filling | $10 |
| Silicone spray | Seals, hinges | $10 |
| Trim removal tools | Panel access | $15 |
| Zip ties (assorted) | Wire management | $5 |
| **Total** | | **$50** |

This kit will fix 90% of Tesla interior rattles.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Avoid extreme temperatures when possible** - Rapid temp changes stress plastic clips
2. **Keep interior clean** - Debris in tracks causes noise
3. **Check after car washes** - Water can get into panels
4. **Re-seat panels after any service** - Techs don't always clip things back properly
5. **Address rattles early** - They often get worse over time

*Rattles are annoying but rarely serious. With patience and a systematic approach, you can track down and eliminate most noises for under $50. Start with the common locations above, and work through your car section by section.*
