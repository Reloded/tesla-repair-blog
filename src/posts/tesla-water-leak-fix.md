Water leaking into your Tesla is one of the most frustrating issues owners deal with. You open the trunk after a rainstorm and find a puddle sitting there, or worse, you hear water sloshing around inside the trunk lid itself. This problem is well documented on both the Model 3 and Model Y, and Tesla even released a service bulletin (SB-23-10-002) specifically addressing trunk lid water ingress.

The good news: most Tesla water leaks come from a handful of known spots, and you can fix them yourself with basic tools and some automotive sealant. No special training required.

## Where Tesla Water Leaks Actually Come From

Before grabbing the sealant, you need to figure out where the water is getting in. Tesla water leaks fall into four main categories:

### 1. Trunk Lid Seam Sealer Gaps (Most Common)

This is the big one. During manufacturing, Tesla applies seam sealer where metal panels overlap inside the trunk lid. On many cars — especially early Model 3 builds from 2017-2020 — there are gaps or skips in this sealant. Water gets past the outer trunk seal, travels along the sheet metal seams, and pools inside the trunk lid or drips into the trunk well.

You'll know this is your problem if:
- Water sloshes around inside the trunk lid when you open or close it
- Water drips from the edges of the trunk lid inner panel
- The leak is worse after heavy rain or car washes

### 2. Tail Light Seal Failure

The tail lights bolt through the body panel and into the trunk area. Each light has a rubber gasket that seals against the body. If the gasket is compressed, damaged, or the light wasn't tightened properly at the factory, water wicks past the seal and runs down into the trunk.

Tesla released a fix for this on the Model Y — a thicker gasket that provides a better seal. Signs of a tail light leak:
- Water stains or moisture near the tail light mounting area inside the trunk
- Condensation inside the tail light housing itself
- Water appearing specifically near the left or right side of the trunk

### 3. A-Pillar / Windshield Seal Leak (Model Y)

Some Model Y owners report water dripping into the cabin through the A-pillar area. This happens when sealant wasn't properly applied where the windshield meets the body structure. Water runs down behind the interior trim and drips onto the dashboard or footwell area.

Signs:
- Water dripping near the top of the windshield pillar during rain
- Damp headliner or wet spots on the dashboard
- Musty smell from trapped moisture behind trim panels

### 4. Liftgate Seal Issues (Model Y)

The Model Y liftgate is larger than the Model 3 trunk and has a longer seal perimeter. The weatherstrip can develop flat spots or fail to compress properly against the body, allowing water past. Tesla service centers have addressed this by replacing or re-seating the liftgate seal, but the fix sometimes only works temporarily.

## How to Diagnose the Leak

Before tearing things apart, do a controlled water test:

1. **Dry the trunk completely.** Wipe everything down and lay paper towels in the trunk well and along the edges.
2. **Have someone spray water** with a garden hose (gentle stream, not power washer) along the trunk seal, tail lights, and rear window area. Start from the bottom and work up.
3. **Check inside every 30 seconds.** The paper towels will show you exactly where water is entering.
4. **Check inside the trunk lid.** Pop off the inner trunk lid panel (it pulls off with trim clips) and look for water running along seams.

For A-pillar leaks, spray along the top of the windshield and sides while someone watches inside.

## Fix 1: Sealing Trunk Lid Seam Gaps

This is the fix that addresses the most common leak source. Tesla's own service bulletin (SB-23-10-002) describes this procedure for the Model Y, but the principle applies to Model 3 as well.

**What you'll need:**
- Polyurethane or silicone automotive seam sealer
- Caulking gun
- Isopropyl alcohol and clean rags
- Trim removal tools
- Flashlight

**Steps:**

1. **Open the trunk and remove the inner trunk lid panel.** On the Model 3, this panel is held by push clips around the perimeter. Use a trim removal tool to carefully pry each clip free. On the Model Y liftgate, you'll need to remove similar trim panels to access the inner structure.

2. **Remove the factory foam pieces.** Tesla's service bulletin calls out two foam pieces (one on each side) located under the lamp can panels inside the trunk lid. Pull these out — they trap water instead of blocking it.

3. **Clean the seam areas.** Wipe down all the metal seams with isopropyl alcohol. You need a clean, dry surface for the sealant to bond properly. Pay close attention to:
   - The corners of the trunk lid where panels overlap
   - Seams running along the edges near the tail light openings
   - Any spot where you can see bare metal or gaps in the existing factory sealer

4. **Apply seam sealer.** Run a bead of polyurethane sealant along every metal-to-metal seam inside the trunk lid. Focus on:
   - Overlapping panel joints
   - The corners where the deck lid panels meet
   - Any visible gaps or skips in the original factory sealer
   - Small holes or openings in the sheet metal (these should not be there — seal them)

5. **Let it cure.** Most automotive sealants need 24-48 hours to fully cure. Don't close the trunk lid or get it wet during this time.

6. **Water test again.** After curing, repeat the hose test to verify the leak is fixed.

7. **Reinstall the inner panel.** Press the push clips back into place. Skip reinstalling the foam pieces — they're not doing anything useful.

## Fix 2: Tail Light Reseal

If your water test pointed to the tail light area:

1. **Open the trunk** and locate the tail light mounting hardware. On the Model 3, each tail light is secured with T30 Torx fasteners accessible from inside the trunk.

2. **Remove the tail light.** Unscrew the fasteners and carefully pull the light straight back. Disconnect the wiring harness.

3. **Inspect the gasket.** Look for compression damage, tears, or areas where the gasket has gone flat. If the gasket looks worn, replace it. Tesla sells replacement gaskets, or you can find aftermarket options.

4. **Clean the mounting surface.** Wipe both the body panel surface and the light housing with isopropyl alcohol.

5. **Apply sealant to seams behind the light.** With the light removed, inspect the body seams that are normally hidden. Apply seam sealer to any gaps where the metal overlaps — this is a very common entry point that people miss.

6. **Reinstall the tail light.** Make sure the gasket seats evenly all the way around and tighten the fasteners snugly. Don't overtighten — you'll crush the gasket and create a new leak path.

7. **Water test** to confirm the fix.

## Fix 3: A-Pillar Leak (Professional Recommended)

A-pillar leaks involve the windshield-to-body seal and are trickier to fix properly at home. The standard fix is applying silicone sealant where the windshield meets the body at the A-pillar junction.

If you want to try it yourself:
1. Carefully peel back the rubber windshield trim at the A-pillar
2. Clean the gap with isopropyl alcohol
3. Apply a thin bead of clear automotive silicone sealant
4. Press the trim back into place
5. Let cure 24 hours before water testing

For persistent A-pillar leaks, a Tesla service appointment is the better move. The windshield may need to be reseated — that's not a DIY job.

## Fix 4: Liftgate Weatherstrip (Model Y)

For Model Y liftgate leaks, start with the simple fix:

1. **Inspect the weatherstrip** all the way around the liftgate opening. Look for sections that appear crushed, folded, or pulled away from the body.
2. **Reseat any loose sections.** The weatherstrip sits in a channel — push it firmly back into place.
3. **Check the liftgate alignment.** If the gap between the liftgate and body is uneven, the seal won't compress evenly. Liftgate striker adjustment can help, but major alignment issues need professional attention.
4. **Replace the seal if damaged.** The full weatherstrip is available as a replacement part. It pulls out of the channel and the new one presses in.

## Preventing Future Leaks

- **Check your trunk after heavy rain** for the first few months of ownership. Catching leaks early prevents water damage to the trunk carpet and any cargo.
- **Inspect tail light gaskets** whenever you replace a bulb or tail light assembly. A two-minute visual check can save you a soggy trunk.
- **Don't use pressure washers directly on seals.** The high-pressure stream can force water past seals that would hold up fine in normal rain.
- **Keep weatherstrips clean.** Dirt and debris on trunk seals prevent them from closing properly. Wipe them down with a damp cloth occasionally.

## When to Go to Tesla Service

Handle it yourself if the leak is from trunk lid seams, tail light gaskets, or a loose weatherstrip. These are straightforward fixes with basic tools.

Take it to Tesla service if:
- The leak is coming from the A-pillar or windshield area
- You've sealed everything you can find and the leak persists
- **The car is still under warranty** — trunk lid water ingress is a known manufacturing issue and Tesla should fix it for free
- You see signs of corrosion or electrical issues from prolonged water exposure

## What This Costs

| Fix | DIY Cost | Tesla Service |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| Trunk lid seam sealing | €15-25 (sealant + supplies) | €100-300 |
| Tail light reseal/gasket | €10-30 | €80-150 |
| Weatherstrip replacement | €40-80 (part) | €150-250 |
| A-pillar/windshield reseal | €10-20 (sealant) | €200-500 |

## Reference

- **Tesla Service Bulletin SB-23-10-002:** "Reseal Trunk Lid to Prevent Water Ingress" — applies to Model Y, details the factory seam sealer gap fix
- **Affected models:** Model 3 (2017-2023, especially pre-2020 builds), Model Y (all years)
- **2024+ Highland/Juniper:** Tesla improved manufacturing tolerances significantly, but check anyway if you notice moisture after rain

Water leaks are annoying but they're not complicated to fix. A tube of sealant and an afternoon of work will sort out most cases. Just make sure to water test before and after — guessing where the leak is coming from almost never works out.
