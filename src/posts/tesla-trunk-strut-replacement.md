Your Tesla trunk barely lifts itself anymore. It opens halfway and stops, or you have to hold it up with one hand while grabbing groceries with the other. Maybe it used to pop open automatically but now just sort of… drifts upward like it's tired. Sound familiar?

Worn trunk struts (also called lift supports or gas springs) are one of the most common Tesla issues after 3-5 years of ownership. The fix is straightforward, takes 20-45 minutes, and costs $40-120 depending on whether you have power or manual struts.

**Here's the catch:** Model 3 and Model Y use completely different trunk/liftgate designs, and the strut replacement process differs significantly between them. This guide covers both.

## ⚡ Quick Info

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Difficulty** | Easy-Medium (2/5) |
| **Time** | 20-45 minutes |
| **Cost** | $40-120 (pair of struts) |
| **Tesla Service Cost** | $200-400+ |
| **Models** | Model 3 (2017+), Model Y (2020+) |
| **Tools needed** | Trim tools, IPA wipes, prop rod |

## Symptoms: How to Know Your Trunk Struts Are Failing

- **Trunk won't stay fully open** — sags down under its own weight
- **Slow rise** — trunk opens sluggishly instead of popping up
- **Trunk stops halfway** — doesn't reach full open position
- **Power trunk makes grinding/straining noises** — motor working harder to compensate
- **Oil residue on the strut cylinder** — seal failure, gas is leaking
- **Trunk drops when releasing** — no gas pressure remaining at all
- **Uneven opening** — one side lifts faster than the other (one strut failing)

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Quick test:</strong> Open your trunk fully and let go. A healthy trunk should stay put with zero droop. If it drops even 1-2 inches over 30 seconds, your struts are on the way out.
</div>

## Model 3 vs Model Y: Key Differences

This is important to understand before ordering parts or starting the job.

### Tesla Model 3 — Trunk Lid (Sedan)

The Model 3 has a traditional **sedan trunk lid** that hinges upward. It's relatively light compared to the Model Y liftgate.

- **Pre-2024 Model 3:** Has two trunk struts — either manual gas struts or power struts (with electric motor) depending on trim and year
- **2024+ Model 3 Highland:** All versions come with power trunk as standard
- **Strut type:** Clips onto ball studs at both ends (upper on trunk lid, lower on body)
- **Power struts have an electrical connector** that must be disconnected before removal

**OEM Part Numbers (Model 3 Power Struts):**
- LH (Left): **1551488-00-C** (also 1551488-98-B, 1551488-99-B)
- RH (Right): **1551489-00-C**

### Tesla Model Y — Liftgate (SUV/Hatchback)

The Model Y has a large **rear liftgate** (hatchback-style) that's significantly heavier than the Model 3 trunk lid. This means:

- Struts need higher force ratings to support the heavier liftgate
- All Model Y vehicles come with **power liftgate** as standard
- The struts have electrical connectors and route through grommets in the body
- Replacement requires accessing the area between the headliner and roof glass

**OEM Part Numbers (Model Y Power Struts):**
- LH (Left): **1500601-00-A**
- RH (Right): **1500602-00-A**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Model 3 and Model Y struts are NOT interchangeable.</strong> They have different lengths, force ratings, and mounting configurations. Always order the correct part for your specific vehicle.
</div>

## Power Struts vs Manual Gas Struts

### Power Struts (Motorized)
- Found on: All Model Y, Model 3 with power trunk option, all 2024+ Model 3
- Have an **electric motor** built into the strut that actively opens/closes the trunk
- Include an **electrical harness connector** — you must disconnect it during replacement
- More expensive ($80-120 per pair aftermarket, $150-200+ OEM)
- Tesla correction code: **1133070022** (Model 3), **11334202** (Model Y)

### Manual Gas Struts (Passive)
- Found on: Some early Model 3 base/SR+ trims without power trunk
- Pure gas springs — no motor, no electrical connection
- Simply provide lift assist when you manually open the trunk
- Cheaper ($30-60 per pair)
- Popular **upgrade option**: Replace weak OEM manual struts with stronger aftermarket ones for automatic opening

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Upgrade opportunity:</strong> If your Model 3 has manual (non-power) trunk struts, you can install stronger aftermarket gas struts that will pop the trunk open fully on their own — essentially giving you "automatic" trunk opening without the power trunk motor. Brands like EVANNEX and TAPTES sell these upgrade kits for around $40-60.
</div>

## What You'll Need

### Tools
- Plastic trim removal tools (for trunk garnish/trim)
- Clean microfiber cloths
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) wipes — for cleaning ball studs before install
- A prop rod or sturdy stick to hold the trunk/liftgate open during replacement
- Inflatable air wedge bag (Model Y — to access connector behind headliner)

### Parts
- Replacement struts — **always replace as a pair** (left and right)
- If ordering aftermarket, verify compatibility with your model year

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Always replace both struts together.</strong> If one is failing, the other isn't far behind. Mismatched struts cause uneven stress on hinges and can lead to alignment issues.
</div>

### Where to Buy

**OEM struts** can be ordered through Tesla Service or parts suppliers like [Tesloid](https://tesloid.com), [Tesla Parts Catalog](https://parts.tesla.com), or pulled from salvage vehicles on eBay.

## Step-by-Step: Model 3 Trunk Strut Replacement (Power Struts)

*Based on Tesla Service Manual procedure — correction code 1133070022, FRT 0.12 hrs*

### Step 1: Remove Trunk Garnish (Interior Trim)

Open the trunk fully. You need to remove the interior trunk garnish (trim panel) to access the power strut's electrical connector.

1. Use a plastic trim tool to carefully pry the trunk garnish panel
2. Work around the clips — they pop off with moderate force
3. Set the garnish aside

*See also: [Garnish - Trunk (Remove and Replace)](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Model3/ServiceManual/2024/en-us/GUID-81AE7DD7-122C-4206-81F3-A3A53D9EFB16.html) in the Tesla Service Manual*

### Step 2: Disconnect the Electrical Harness

Near the LH (left-hand) side of the vehicle interior where the trunk garnish was removed:

1. Locate the trunk power strut electrical connector
2. Press the release tab and disconnect the harness

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Take a photo</strong> of the connector routing before disconnecting. This helps during reinstallation.
</div>

### Step 3: Push the Rubber Grommet Through

The power strut's wiring passes through the body via a rubber grommet:

1. Locate the rubber grommet where the strut harness passes through the body panel
2. Push the grommet through from the interior side

### Step 4: Support the Trunk

**This is critical.** Before removing struts:

1. Use a prop rod, sturdy stick, or have a helper hold the trunk lid open
2. Without strut support, the trunk lid will fall and could cause injury or damage

### Step 5: Release the Upper Ball Stud Clip

1. Locate the clip connecting the upper end of the strut to the trunk lid ball stud
2. Use a flat trim tool or your fingers to release the clip
3. Pull the strut end off the ball stud

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Caution:</strong> The strut is under gas pressure. Even a weak strut has some spring force. Control it as you release each end.
</div>

### Step 6: Release the Lower Ball Stud Clip

1. Release the clip attaching the lower end of the strut to the body-side ball stud
2. Remove the strut from the vehicle

### Step 7: Install the New Strut

Installation is the reverse:

1. **Clean both ball studs** with an IPA wipe — this ensures a secure clip connection
2. **Attach the lower end first** — clip it onto the lower body-side ball stud
3. **Attach the upper end** — clip onto the upper trunk lid ball stud
4. **Verify both clips are fully seated** — tug gently to confirm

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Make sure that the clips attaching the power strut ends to the trunk are securely fastened. A loose strut can detach and cause damage or injury.
</div>

5. Remove the trunk prop
6. Pull the rubber grommet back through the body panel
7. Reconnect the electrical harness connector
8. Reinstall the trunk garnish

### Step 8: Test

1. Close the trunk fully
2. Open it using the button/touchscreen/key fob
3. Verify it opens fully and holds position
4. Close it and verify smooth operation
5. Repeat a few times to confirm

## Step-by-Step: Model Y Liftgate Strut Replacement (Power Struts)

*Based on Tesla Service Manual procedure — correction code 11334202, FRT 0.18 hrs*

The Model Y procedure is slightly more involved because you need to access the strut connector behind the rear headliner.

### Step 1: Open Liftgate and Rear Door

1. Open the liftgate fully
2. Open the LH (left) rear door — this gives you access to the headliner area

### Step 2: Access the Connector Behind the Headliner

This is the trickiest part of the Model Y procedure:

1. Position an inflatable air wedge bag between the rear headliner and the roof glass
2. Gently inflate to create a gap that lets you reach the power strut connector
3. Apply tape to the headliner edges as needed to prevent scratching

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>No air wedge?</strong> You can carefully use a plastic trim tool wrapped in a microfiber cloth to gently pry the headliner down enough to access the connector. Be gentle — headliner material damages easily.
</div>

### Step 3: Disconnect the Power Strut Connector

1. Reach behind the headliner through the gap you created
2. Disconnect the liftgate power strut electrical connector

### Step 4: Release the Harness Grommet

1. Release the tabs that attach the electrical harness grommet to the body
2. Pull the grommet free from the body panel

### Step 5: Support the Liftgate

1. Use a prop rod to support the liftgate — it's heavy!
2. The Model Y liftgate weighs significantly more than a Model 3 trunk lid

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>The Model Y liftgate is heavy.</strong> Make sure your prop is sturdy and well-positioned. A falling liftgate can cause serious injury. Consider having a helper.
</div>

### Step 6: Release the Lower Ball Stud

1. Release the lower liftgate power strut from the ball stud attached to the vehicle body
2. Control the strut as you release it

### Step 7: Release the Upper Ball Stud and Remove

1. Release the upper liftgate power strut from the ball stud on the liftgate
2. Remove the strut from the vehicle

### Step 8: Install the New Strut

1. **Clip the upper ball stud first** (opposite order from Model 3) — attach to the liftgate
2. **Clip the lower ball stud** — attach to the vehicle body
3. Route the electrical harness through the body and secure the grommet
4. Connect the liftgate power strut electrical connector
5. Remove the inflatable air wedge bag from between the headliner and roof glass
6. Close the liftgate and rear door

### Step 9: Test

1. Open the liftgate using the button on the liftgate, touchscreen, or key fob
2. Verify it opens fully and holds position
3. Close and reopen several times
4. Listen for any unusual noises

## Model 3 Manual Strut Upgrade (Non-Power Trunk)

If your Model 3 has the **non-power trunk** (common on 2017-2020 Standard Range / SR+ models), you have simple gas struts with no electrical connections. The replacement is even simpler:

1. Prop the trunk open
2. Release the clip on the upper ball stud
3. Release the clip on the lower ball stud
4. Remove old strut
5. Clean ball studs with IPA
6. Clip new strut onto lower ball stud
7. Clip new strut onto upper ball stud
8. Remove prop and test

**Upgrade tip:** The factory manual struts are designed to *assist* opening — you still need to push the trunk up. Aftermarket struts from brands like [EVANNEX](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=evannex+tesla+model+3+trunk+lift+struts&tag=diyrepair07-20) or [TAPTES](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=taptes+tesla+model+3+trunk+strut+upgrade&tag=diyrepair07-20) use higher force ratings that pop the trunk open fully — like having a power trunk without the motor.

---

## Troubleshooting After Replacement

### Trunk still won't stay open
- Verify both clips are fully seated on the ball studs
- Check if ball studs themselves are worn or damaged — they can be replaced separately
- For Model Y, see [Ball Stud - Liftgate](https://service.tesla.com/docs/ModelY/ServiceManual/en-us/GUID-2C44723F-E949-47E4-88A7-C4D41672B76E.html) procedure

### Power trunk opens/closes erratically
- Make sure the electrical connector is fully seated
- Check for pinched wires in the grommet
- A touchscreen recalibration may be needed: go to **Controls > Service > Calibrate Trunk** (if available on your software version)

### Trunk opens too far or not far enough
- If you installed aftermarket upgraded struts (higher force), the trunk may open more aggressively — this is normal
- Adjust the trunk opening height in **Controls > Vehicle > Trunk** on the touchscreen

### Clicking or popping noise
- Ball studs may need replacement
- Clips may not be fully seated
- Apply a small amount of silicone grease to the ball studs
