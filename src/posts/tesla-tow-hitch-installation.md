Adding a tow hitch to your Tesla opens up a lot of practical capability — bike racks, small cargo trailers, camping gear carriers, even light towing. And whether you go with the Tesla OEM package or an aftermarket hitch, this is a job you can do at home with basic tools and a couple of hours.

Here's everything you need to know about the options, the installation process, and what to expect from towing with an EV.

## Towing Capacity by Model

Before you buy anything, know what your Tesla can actually tow:

**Model Y (All Configurations):**
- Maximum towing capacity: 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg)
- Maximum tongue weight: 350 lbs (159 kg)
- Hitch receiver: 2-inch (OEM)

**Model 3 (Europe — factory tow option available):**
- Maximum towing capacity: 2,000 lbs (910 kg) — varies by market
- Hitch type: 50mm ball coupling (OEM)
- Note: Not all markets offer a factory tow option for Model 3

**Model 3 (North America — aftermarket only):**
- Tesla does not sell an OEM tow package for Model 3 in North America
- Aftermarket hitches typically rated for 2,000 lbs towing and 200 lbs tongue weight
- Hitch receiver: 1.25-inch or 2-inch depending on brand

These numbers assume your vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) is not exceeded. That means the weight of the car, passengers, cargo, AND tongue weight combined can't go over the GVWR listed on your door jamb sticker.

## OEM vs Aftermarket: Which One?

### Tesla OEM Tow Package (Model Y)

**Price:** Around $1,000–$1,300 through Tesla (parts + installation), or $500–$700 for the parts alone if you install it yourself.

**What's included:**
- High-strength steel tow bar with 2-inch hitch receiver
- 7-pin wiring harness (North American standard)
- All mounting hardware
- Hitch cover for when the receiver isn't in use

**Pros:**
- Designed specifically for the vehicle — perfect fitment
- Integrates with the car's software for trailer mode, brake lights, and turn signals
- No drilling or cutting required
- Maintains warranty coverage

**Cons:**
- More expensive than aftermarket
- Tesla installation can take weeks to schedule
- Requires the tow-capable Left-Hand (LH) Body Controller Module for retrofit installs — more on this below

### Aftermarket Options

The most popular aftermarket hitches for Tesla:

**EcoHitch by Torklift Central:**
- Model Y: Starting at $350
- Model 3: Starting at $350
- Stealth design that hides behind the bumper
- No drilling into the frame
- Comes with wiring harness option

**Draw-Tite / CURT:**
- Model Y: $200–$350
- Model 3: $200–$300
- Standard bolt-on installation
- Widely available through U-Haul, Amazon, and auto parts stores

**Pros of aftermarket:**
- Significantly cheaper
- More readily available
- Installation is well-documented (U-Haul even has video guides)

**Cons of aftermarket:**
- May not integrate with Tesla's trailer mode software
- Wiring can be more complex
- Some designs are visible below the bumper
- Doesn't come with Tesla's software features (trailer turn signal animation, etc.)

## What You Need to Know About the Wiring

This is where Tesla tow hitch installations get tricky, and where most DIYers hit unexpected problems.

### OEM Wiring (Model Y)

The Tesla OEM wiring harness plugs into an existing connector behind the rear bumper. However, if your Model Y didn't come with the tow package from the factory, you may need a **tow-capable LH Body Controller Module**. This is a different hardware module than what non-tow vehicles ship with.

Without this module, you can bolt on the hitch and plug in the wiring harness, but you won't get power to the trailer connector — no brake lights, no turn signals, nothing.

**How to check if you need one:**
1. Go to your touchscreen: Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information
2. Look for "Tow Package" in the options list
3. If it's not listed, you likely need the controller module swap

The LH Body Controller Module costs around $200–$400 for the part. A Tesla service center can install and configure it, but it's also doable as a DIY job if you're comfortable with automotive wiring.

### Aftermarket Wiring

Aftermarket wiring harnesses tap into the vehicle's existing tail light wiring. This is simpler because you don't need the tow-capable body controller — you're just splicing into the light signals directly.

Most aftermarket kits come with:
- T-connector harness (plugs between the tail light connector and the vehicle harness)
- 4-pin flat connector (standard for most trailers in North America)
- Some kits include a 7-pin to 4-pin adapter

The downside: aftermarket wiring won't trigger Tesla's trailer mode on the touchscreen. You won't get the trailer visualization or automatic adjustments to Autopilot behavior.

## Step-by-Step Installation (Model Y OEM)

**Time needed:** 2–3 hours

**Difficulty:** Medium — you need to remove the rear bumper, which is intimidating the first time but straightforward once you know where the clips are.

### Step 1: Remove the Rear Bumper Fascia

1. Open the trunk and locate the push-pin clips along the top edge of the rear bumper (inside the trunk opening). There are typically 8–10 clips.
2. Use a trim removal tool to pop each clip out. Work carefully — these clips are reusable if you don't break them.
3. Remove the two Torx T30 screws on each side, located inside the wheel well liner near the rear bumper corners.
4. Remove the clips along the bottom edge of the bumper (underneath the car).
5. Starting from the corners, gently pull the bumper fascia away from the body. It's held on by clips along the sides.
6. Disconnect the parking sensor wiring connectors and any other electrical connectors before fully removing the bumper.
7. Set the bumper fascia on a blanket or soft surface to avoid scratching it.

### Step 2: Install the Hitch Crossbar

1. The OEM hitch assembly bolts to the rear subframe/crash structure using the existing bolt holes. No drilling required.
2. Position the hitch assembly and hand-thread all bolts before torquing any of them.
3. Torque the mounting bolts to the specification included with your kit — typically 75–80 ft-lbs (100–108 Nm) for the main frame bolts. Always use the torque spec from your specific hitch kit.
4. Double-check that the hitch receiver is level and centered.

### Step 3: Route the Wiring Harness

1. Route the 7-pin wiring harness from the hitch receiver area up to the connector location behind the left tail light.
2. Plug the harness into the vehicle's tow connector (if your car has the tow-capable body controller).
3. Secure the wiring with zip ties along the existing wire runs. Keep it away from exhaust heat, moving parts, and sharp edges.
4. Route the 7-pin connector out through the opening near the hitch receiver.

### Step 4: Reinstall the Bumper

1. Reconnect all electrical connectors (parking sensors, etc.).
2. Align the bumper fascia starting from the top and work your way down, pressing firmly at each clip location until you hear them snap in.
3. Reinstall the Torx screws in the wheel well liners.
4. Reinstall the push-pin clips along the top and bottom edges.
5. Check all gaps are even and the bumper sits flush.

### Step 5: Enable Tow Mode in Software

After installation, you may need to enable the tow package in your vehicle's software:

1. On the touchscreen, navigate to Controls > Suspension (if equipped) or Controls > Pedals & Steering
2. Look for a "Trailer Mode" option
3. If Trailer Mode doesn't appear, a Tesla service center may need to push a software configuration to your vehicle

Once enabled, plugging in a trailer will automatically:
- Disable Autopilot (on most versions)
- Adjust regenerative braking behavior
- Show a trailer icon on the touchscreen
- Enable trailer turn signal indicators

## Step-by-Step Installation (Model 3 Aftermarket)

**Time needed:** 1.5–2.5 hours

### Step 1: Access the Mounting Points

1. Remove the rear bumper fascia (same process as Model Y — clips along top edge, Torx screws in wheel wells, clips underneath).
2. Remove the tail lights to access the wiring (two bolts per light, then unplug the connector).

### Step 2: Mount the Hitch

1. Aftermarket hitches like the EcoHitch bolt to the rear crash bar / bumper reinforcement beam.
2. You may need a helper to hold the hitch in position while you thread the bolts.
3. Follow the torque specifications included with your specific hitch. Typical range is 30–45 ft-lbs for the mounting bolts on aftermarket Model 3 hitches.
4. Some kits require you to trim a small section of the rear underbody panel to allow the receiver to pass through. Mark the cut line carefully and use a rotary tool.

### Step 3: Install the Wiring Harness

1. Plug the T-connector harness between the tail light connectors and the vehicle harness.
2. Route the 4-pin (or 7-pin) connector down to the hitch receiver area.
3. Test all lights before buttoning everything back up: left turn, right turn, brake lights, running lights.

### Step 4: Reassemble

1. Reinstall tail lights and reconnect their plugs.
2. Reinstall the rear bumper fascia.
3. Tuck and zip-tie all wiring away from heat and moving parts.

## How Towing Affects Range

This is the question everyone asks, and the answer is: towing has a bigger impact on EV range than it does on a gas car. Expect to lose 30–50% of your rated range when towing, depending on:

- **Weight of the trailer and cargo** — heavier loads use more energy
- **Aerodynamic drag** — a tall, boxy trailer is the worst case
- **Speed** — towing at 55 mph vs 70 mph can make a 20% difference in energy consumption
- **Terrain** — hills will eat range, but you'll recover some going downhill through regenerative braking
- **Weather** — cold weather compounds the range loss

**Practical example:** A Model Y with 300 miles of rated range might see 150–200 miles of real range while towing a small utility trailer (1,500 lbs) at highway speeds. Plan your Supercharger stops accordingly.

**Tips for maximizing range while towing:**
- Keep speed at or below 60 mph
- Use a aerodynamic trailer if possible
- Pre-condition the battery before departure
- Plan routes with Supercharger stops every 100–120 miles
- Avoid steep mountain passes if possible, or charge to near-full before climbing

## Common Mistakes and Troubleshooting

### No Power to Trailer Connector

If you installed an OEM hitch and harness but get no power to the 7-pin connector:
- Check whether your vehicle has the tow-capable LH Body Controller Module
- Verify the wiring harness connector is fully seated (it should click)
- Check the fuse — there's a dedicated tow fuse in the rear fuse box

### Bumper Doesn't Sit Flush After Reinstallation

- Double-check that all parking sensor connectors are plugged back in
- Make sure no wiring is pinched between the bumper and the body
- Verify all clips snapped in fully — sometimes one missed clip causes a gap

### Trailer Lights Don't Work Correctly

- With aftermarket T-connector harnesses, the most common issue is a ground problem. Make sure the ground wire has a clean, paint-free connection to the vehicle's chassis.
- If turn signals flash fast (hyperflash), you may need a load resistor or LED-compatible flasher relay.

### Autopilot Warning When Trailer Is Connected

This is normal. Most Tesla software versions disable or limit Autopilot when a trailer is detected (either through the 7-pin connector or manually in the touchscreen). Basic Autopilot (TACC + lane keeping) may still work in some configurations, but Full Self-Driving features will be restricted.

## Cost Summary

| Component | OEM (Model Y) | Aftermarket (Model 3/Y) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Hitch assembly | $300–$500 | $200–$400 |
| Wiring harness | $100–$200 | $50–$150 |
| Body Controller Module (if needed) | $200–$400 | Not needed |
| Tesla installation labor | $200–$400 | N/A |
| **Total (DIY)** | **$400–$700** | **$250–$550** |
| **Total (professional install)** | **$1,000–$1,300** | **$400–$800** |

## Is It Worth Doing Yourself?

If you've ever removed a car bumper before, absolutely. The hardest part of this job is getting the rear bumper off and back on without breaking clips. The actual hitch mounting is just bolting on a steel bar.

For the OEM Model Y package, the savings over having Tesla do it are $300–$600, and you get the satisfaction of knowing exactly how your car is put together.

For aftermarket installs on Model 3, DIY is almost the default since Tesla doesn't offer an official solution in North America. Budget a Saturday afternoon, watch the U-Haul or EcoHitch installation videos for your specific kit, and take your time with the bumper clips.

One last thing — once the hitch is installed, even if you never tow anything, a 2-inch receiver opens up a world of accessories: bike racks, cargo carriers, hitch steps, and even a portable grill platform for tailgating at the Supercharger. The hitch pays for itself faster than you'd think.
