HomeLink is Tesla's built-in garage door opener that can automatically open your garage as you approach home. Once set up, it's incredibly convenient—but the initial programming can be tricky. This guide walks you through the setup process and common troubleshooting steps.

## What Is HomeLink?

HomeLink is a universal garage door opener integrated into your Tesla. It can:

- Control up to 3 garage doors or gates
- Auto-open as you approach your set location
- Auto-close as you leave
- Work with most garage door brands

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> HomeLink is standard on Model S and Model X. On Model 3 and Model Y, HomeLink requires a separate purchase (~$350) unless included with your trim package.

## Before You Start

### Check Compatibility

HomeLink works with most garage door systems, including:
- LiftMaster
- Chamberlain
- Genie
- Overhead Door
- Craftsman
- Wayne Dalton
- Linear
- Most rolling-code systems

### What You Need

1. Access to your garage door opener (the ceiling unit)
2. A ladder to reach the learn button (on most openers)
3. Your existing garage remote (helpful but not required)

## Programming HomeLink: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access HomeLink Settings

1. Park within range of your garage door
2. On touchscreen: Tap **Controls > HomeLink**
3. Tap **Add New HomeLink**
4. Enter a name for this garage (e.g., "Home Garage")

### Step 2: Train from Existing Remote (Method 1)

If you have a working remote:

1. Hold the remote 5-8 cm from the front bumper (where the HomeLink transmitter is located)
2. Press and hold the remote button
3. Tesla screen will show "Training" progress
4. Continue until training completes (may take 30-60 seconds)

### Step 3: Complete Programming at Garage Opener

Most garage doors use **rolling codes** for security and require this additional step:

1. Go to your garage door opener unit (ceiling-mounted)
2. Find the **Learn** or **Smart** button (usually colored: purple, orange, yellow, or green)
3. Press and release the Learn button (LED will light up)
4. Within 30 seconds, return to your Tesla
5. Press your new HomeLink button on the Tesla screen
6. Press it again if the garage doesn't respond
7. The garage door should move

<strong>Tip:</strong> The Learn button location varies by brand. Check your garage opener's manual or look for a colored button near the antenna wire.
</div>

### Alternative: Program Without Existing Remote

If you don't have a remote:

1. Start at Step 1 above (add new HomeLink in Tesla)
2. Select "Create HomeLink" instead of training from remote
3. Choose your garage opener brand and model
4. Follow on-screen instructions for your specific opener
5. Complete the Learn button step at the opener unit

## Setting Up Auto-Open and Auto-Close

Once HomeLink is programmed:

### Enable Auto Features

1. **Controls > HomeLink**
2. Select your programmed garage
3. Enable **Auto-Open when Arriving**
4. Set the distance to trigger (recommended: 50-100 meters)
5. Enable **Auto-Close when Leaving** if desired

### Set Your Home Location

Auto-open works based on location:

1. **Navigation > Work/Home**
2. Set your home address if not already done
3. HomeLink uses this to know when to trigger

## Programming Multiple Garages

You can program up to 3 doors:

1. **Controls > HomeLink > Add New HomeLink**
2. Repeat the programming steps for each door
3. Name each clearly (e.g., "Main Garage," "Side Gate")

## Troubleshooting HomeLink

### Garage Door Won't Respond

1. **Verify programming completed** - redo the Learn button step
2. **Check range** - must be within 30 meters typically
3. **Reset HomeLink** - delete and reprogram from scratch
4. **Check garage opener** - ensure it responds to manual button

### Auto-Open Not Working

1. **Check location settings** - home address must be correct
2. **Verify feature is enabled** - Controls > HomeLink > Auto settings
3. **Check distance setting** - may need adjustment
4. **Bluetooth/location on phone** - needed for some features

### Works Intermittently

- Garage opener may need antenna adjustment
- Interference from other devices
- Weak signal - try reducing trigger distance
- Battery in garage opener may need replacement

### "Signal Not Detected" Error

- Remote battery may be dead during training
- Hold remote closer to front bumper
- Try different remote if available
- Some very old systems aren't compatible

## Security Features

HomeLink has built-in security measures:

- **PIN required option** - require PIN entry before HomeLink works
- **Won't work via app** - only from inside the car
- **Location-based** - only triggers near programmed location

## Resetting HomeLink

To start fresh:

1. **Controls > HomeLink**
2. Select the garage to delete
3. Tap **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion
5. Reprogram if needed

## HomeLink Not Available?

### Model 3/Y Without HomeLink Installed

HomeLink is an add-on for these models:
- Purchase from Tesla (~$350)
- Tesla can install it (service appointment)
- Aftermarket installation possible but not recommended

### Alternative Solutions

If you don't have HomeLink:
- Use your garage's smartphone app (most brands offer this)
- Keep original remote in the car
- Consider smart garage controller (MyQ, Tailwind, etc.)

## Tips for Best Performance

1. **Consistent parking spot** - auto features work better with routine
2. **Test range** - find the reliable trigger distance for your garage
3. **Close delay** - set auto-close delay long enough to fully enter
4. **Notify passengers** - auto-opening can surprise people near garage

*HomeLink makes arriving home seamless once properly configured. Take time to set it up correctly, and you'll rarely think about your garage door again.*
