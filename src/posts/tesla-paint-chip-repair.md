Tesla paint is notoriously soft and chip-prone, especially on darker colors. Rock chips are inevitable, but you can repair them yourself for a fraction of what a body shop charges. Here's how to get professional-looking results at home.

## Understanding Tesla Paint

### Why Tesla Paint Chips Easily

- **Water-based paint** - More environmentally friendly but softer
- **Thin clear coat** - Less protection than some manufacturers
- **Aerodynamic shapes** - Front end catches more road debris
- **Large vertical surfaces** - Front fascia is a chip magnet

### Tesla Paint Codes

Find your paint code on the door jamb sticker or in the car's documentation:

| Color Name | Code |
|------------|------|
| Pearl White Multi-Coat | PPSW |
| Solid Black | PBSB |
| Midnight Silver Metallic | PMNG |
| Deep Blue Metallic | PPSB |
| Red Multi-Coat | PPMR |
| Ultra White | PPSW (newer) |
| Quicksilver | - |
| Midnight Cherry Red | - |

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take a photo of your door jamb sticker for easy reference when ordering touch-up paint.
</div>

## Types of Paint Damage

### Level 1: Clear Coat Scratches
- White marks that disappear when wet
- Only in the clear coat, not base paint
- Easiest to fix

### Level 2: Minor Chips
- Small chips from rocks
- Through clear coat to base paint
- May show primer or metal

### Level 3: Deep Chips/Scratches
- Through to primer or bare metal
- Larger than a pencil eraser
- May be starting to rust

### Level 4: Major Damage
- Large scratches or gouges
- Dents with paint damage
- Best left to professionals

## Touch-Up Methods

### Method 1: Touch-Up Paint Pen (Basic)

Best for: Small chips, quick fixes

**Materials needed:**
- Tesla OEM touch-up paint pen
- Isopropyl alcohol
- Microfiber towels

**Steps:**
1. **Clean the chip** - Wash area, then wipe with isopropyl alcohol
2. **Shake the pen** - 2 minutes minimum with ball bearing rattling
3. **Dab, don't stroke** - Apply small amount directly in chip
4. **Build layers** - Multiple thin coats, 30 min between coats
5. **Level (optional)** - After 24 hours, use leveling solution

**Pros:** Quick, easy, inexpensive
**Cons:** Can look obvious, difficult to level properly

### Method 2: Dr. ColorChip System (Recommended)

Best for: Multiple small chips, best DIY results

**How it works:**
- Paint is applied then excess is removed with special solution
- Leaves paint only in the chip, not on surrounding paint
- Much cleaner results than brush-on

**Steps:**
1. **Wash and dry** the car completely
2. **Clean chips** with included SealAct
3. **Apply paint** liberally over chip with brush
4. **Wait 1-3 minutes** for paint to set
5. **Blot with cloth and SealAct** - Removes excess
6. **Buff with dry cloth** - Paint remains only in chip

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Best Results:</strong> Dr. ColorChip is the preferred method for most Tesla owners. The results blend better than traditional touch-up paint.
</div>

### Method 3: Spray Can Touch-Up (Advanced)

Best for: Larger areas, bumper repairs

**When to use:**
- Chips larger than a pencil eraser
- Scratch repairs
- Bumper scrapes

**Materials needed:**
- Color-matched spray paint
- Primer (if bare metal showing)
- Clear coat spray
- Wet/dry sandpaper (1500-3000 grit)
- Masking tape and paper
- Rubbing compound

**Steps:**
1. **Sand the damaged area** - Remove loose paint, feather edges
2. **Mask off surrounding area** - Protect undamaged paint
3. **Apply primer** (if needed) - Light coats, let dry
4. **Apply base coat** - Several light coats
5. **Apply clear coat** - 2-3 light coats
6. **Wet sand** - After 48 hours, 2000 grit
7. **Polish** - Rubbing compound then polish

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Spray painting requires practice. Test on cardboard first. Poor technique can make damage look worse.
</div>

## Color-Specific Tips

### Pearl White Multi-Coat
- Three-stage paint (base, pearl, clear)
- Hardest to touch up perfectly
- Dr. ColorChip white works well for small chips
- Large repairs need professional three-stage process

### Solid Black
- Shows every imperfection
- Touch-ups are more visible
- Consider ceramic coating after repair
- May need wet sanding for level finish

### Midnight Silver Metallic
- Metallic flake can be hard to match
- Use OEM paint for best results
- Apply thin coats to prevent dark spots

### Red Multi-Coat
- Multi-layer paint system
- Similar to white in difficulty
- Professional match is challenging

## Prevention

### Paint Protection Film (PPF)

Best prevention is covering the front end with [PPF installation](/posts/tesla-ppf-installation/):

**Full front package typically includes:**
- Full hood
- Front bumper
- Fenders
- Mirror caps
- Door edges

**Cost:** €1,500-3,000 for full front
**DIY kits:** €300-600

### Ceramic Coating

Doesn't prevent chips but:
- Makes paint easier to clean
- Adds some scratch resistance
- Makes touch-ups blend better
- Protects touch-up repairs

### Mud Flaps

For Model 3/Y especially:
- Reduces side rock chips
- Protects rocker panels
- Inexpensive protection (€50-100)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using wrong paint** - Always match exact color code
2. **Applying too thick** - Multiple thin coats are better
3. **Not cleaning first** - Wax/dirt prevents adhesion
4. **Touching wet paint** - Wait for full cure
5. **Skipping clear coat** - Touch-ups will dull without it
6. **Repairing in bad conditions** - Need 15-25°C, low humidity
7. **Impatience** - Rushing causes poor results

## Professional Repair Options

When DIY isn't enough:

| Service | Cost | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| Mobile touch-up service | €100-200 | Multiple chips, convenience |
| Body shop spot repair | €200-400 | Larger areas |
| Panel respray | €400-800+ | Severe damage |
| Full PPF installation | €1500-3000 | Future prevention |

## Rust Prevention

If you have chips down to bare metal:

1. **Don't wait** - Rust starts quickly
2. **Apply rust converter** if rust is starting
3. **Prime before painting** - Prevents future rust
4. **Seal edges** - Clear coat over touch-up

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Rust Alert:</strong> Any chip showing bare metal should be addressed within a few weeks, especially in wet/winter climates. Rust spreads under the paint.
</div>

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | Cost | Results |
|----------|------|---------|
| OEM touch-up pen | €30-40 | Fair |
| Dr. ColorChip kit | €50-70 | Good |
| Professional touch-up | €100-200 | Very good |
| Panel respray | €400-800 | Excellent |
| Ignore chips | €0 | Rust and lower resale |

## After Touch-Up Care

1. **Wait 7 days** before washing
2. **Don't wax for 30 days** - Paint needs to cure
3. **Apply ceramic coating** after full cure for protection
4. **Park in shade** - UV helps cure but direct sun can damage fresh paint
5. **Don't use pressure washer** on repairs for 30 days

*Paint chip repair is one of the most satisfying DIY fixes. For €50-70 in materials, you can address dozens of chips that would cost hundreds at a body shop. Start with small chips to build confidence before tackling larger repairs.*
