The Tesla Model X falcon wing doors feature a distinctive upper window section that can crack or break from impacts, vandalism, or stress fractures. Tesla service centers quote **$1,500-3,000+** for this repair, but you can do it yourself in about an hour using salvage parts for a fraction of the cost.

## What You'll Need

**Parts:**
- Replacement falcon wing door upper window (left or right, make sure to match your side)
- Source: Tesla salvage yards, eBay, or specialized Tesla parts suppliers

**Expected Cost:**
- Tesla Service Center: $1,500-3,000+
- DIY with salvage parts: $200-500

**Tools:**
- T30 Torx screwdriver (possibly T25 as well)
- Plastic trim removal tools
- Clean microfiber cloths
- Masking tape (to protect paint)

## Identifying Your Part

The falcon wing door has two window sections:
- **Lower window** - The larger section that rolls down
- **Upper window** - The fixed triangular/trapezoidal section at the top of the door

This guide covers the **upper fixed window** replacement. The part number varies by year and whether it's the driver or passenger side. When ordering from salvage, provide your VIN to ensure compatibility.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take photos of your broken window from multiple angles before ordering. Salvage suppliers can help match the exact part you need.
</div>

## Step-by-Step Replacement

### Step 1: Open the Falcon Wing Door Fully

1. Park in a location with plenty of overhead clearance
2. Open the falcon wing door completely
3. If the window damage prevents normal operation, use the manual release

### Step 2: Remove Interior Trim

1. Locate the interior trim panel along the top edge of the door
2. Use plastic pry tools to carefully release the clips
3. Work slowly to avoid breaking the clips
4. Set the trim panel aside safely

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> The trim clips are plastic and can break if you pry too aggressively. Replacement clips are available but it's better to preserve the originals.
</div>

### Step 3: Disconnect Any Wiring (If Applicable)

Some Model X years have:
- Rain sensors
- Defrost elements
- Antenna wiring

If your window has any electrical connections:
1. Photograph the connector before unplugging
2. Press the release tab and gently disconnect
3. Note which connector goes where

### Step 4: Remove the Window Mounting Bolts

1. Locate the Torx bolts securing the window frame (typically T30)
2. There are usually 4-6 bolts along the frame
3. Support the window while removing the final bolts
4. Carefully lift out the damaged window assembly

### Step 5: Clean the Mounting Area

1. Remove any broken glass carefully (wear gloves)
2. Clean the mounting surface with a microfiber cloth
3. Inspect the seals and weatherstripping
4. Replace seals if damaged (order separately if needed)

### Step 6: Install the Replacement Window

1. Test-fit the new window before final installation
2. Align the mounting holes
3. Hand-thread all bolts first to ensure proper alignment
4. Tighten bolts in a star pattern to ensure even pressure
5. Reconnect any electrical connectors

### Step 7: Reinstall Interior Trim

1. Align the trim panel clips with their holes
2. Press firmly until each clip snaps into place
3. Run your hand along the edge to ensure it's fully seated

### Step 8: Test the Door

1. Close the falcon wing door using the button
2. Listen for any unusual sounds
3. Check that the door seals properly (no gaps)
4. Test opening and closing several times

## Where to Find Salvage Parts

Finding the right part is often the hardest step. Try these sources:

- **Tesla salvage specialists** - Companies that part out damaged Teslas
- **eBay** - Search "Model X falcon wing door window" + your year
- **Tesla forums** - TMC (Tesla Motors Club) has a parts marketplace
- **Local salvage yards** - Call ahead to check for Model X inventory

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>What to ask the seller:</strong>
- What year/VIN did this come from?
- Is the glass intact with no cracks?
- Are the mounting brackets included?
- Is any wiring/connector included?
</div>

## Troubleshooting

**Door won't close properly after installation:**
- Recheck bolt torque - may be too tight or loose
- Verify window is properly seated in frame
- Run the [door calibration procedure](/posts/tesla-falcon-wing-door-fix/)

**Water leaks after installation:**
- Inspect weatherstripping for damage
- Check that all seals are properly seated
- May need to apply seal conditioner

**Error messages after installation:**
- If you disconnected sensors, ensure they're reconnected
- Perform a soft reboot (hold both scroll wheels)
- Run falcon wing door calibration from the service menu

## Cost Breakdown

| Item | DIY Cost | Tesla Service |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Upper window (salvage) | $200-400 | Included |
| Labor | Free (1 hour) | $150-300+ |
| Seals (if needed) | $20-50 | Included |
| **Total** | **$200-500** | **$1,500-3,000+** |

You're saving at least $1,000 by doing this yourself, and often much more.
