Tesla power seats are controlled entirely through the touchscreen and steering wheel scroll buttons — there are no manual adjustment levers. When a seat motor fails, you're stuck in whatever position the seat is in. This guide covers diagnosis, fuse checks, manual override, and motor replacement.

## Symptoms

- **Seat won't move** in one or more directions
- **Seat moves intermittently** or gets stuck mid-adjustment
- **Grinding noise** when adjusting the seat
- **Error message** on touchscreen about seat calibration
- **Lumbar support** not working (separate motor)
- **Seat heater works but adjustment doesn't** (or vice versa — see our [seat heater fix](/posts/tesla-seat-heater-fix/))

## Quick Diagnosis

### Step 1: Reboot First

A software glitch can disable seat controls:

1. Hold both scroll wheels on the steering wheel for 10 seconds
2. Wait for the screen to restart
3. Try seat adjustment again

### Step 2: Check the Fuse

Tesla Model 3/Y seat motors are protected by fuses in the rear seat fuse box (under the rear seat cushion, left side).

1. Lift the rear seat cushion (pull up firmly at the front edge)
2. Locate the fuse panel on the left side
3. Find the seat motor fuse (refer to your owner's manual for the exact position)
4. Check if the fuse is blown — replace with the same amperage if so

<strong>Model S/X:</strong> The fuse box is located in the front footwell area (driver's side). Check the owner's manual for your specific year.
</div>

### Step 3: Test Each Direction

Try moving the seat in all directions via the touchscreen:
- Forward/backward (seat track motor)
- Up/down (seat lift motors — typically 2)
- Backrest tilt (recline motor)
- Lumbar support (separate motor)
- Head restraint (Model S/X)

If only one direction is affected, the specific motor for that function has likely failed.

## Manual Override: Moving a Stuck Seat

If you need to move the seat and the motor is dead (critical if you need to access the rear or adjust for driving):

### Model 3/Y Method:

1. Remove the plastic trim panel under the front of the seat (clips, use trim tool)
2. Locate the seat track motor — it's connected to the seat rail via a gear mechanism
3. Disconnect the motor electrical connector
4. Using a 10mm socket on the motor shaft (or the lead screw), manually turn to move the seat forward/back
5. This is slow but effective for emergency repositioning

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Disconnect the 12V battery before working on seat wiring to prevent shorts or unexpected seat movement.
</div>

### Model S/X Method:

The process is similar, but these seats have more motors (up to 12-way adjustment). Access is through the bottom trim panels of the seat.

## Replacing a Seat Motor

If the motor has failed, replacement is the fix. Tesla seat motors are available from parts suppliers for $80–200 each depending on the function.

### What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 1–2 hours per motor
**Skill Level:** Intermediate

### Procedure

1. Disconnect the 12V battery
2. Remove the seat trim panels to access the motor:
   - Bottom panel: clips and screws
   - Side panels: T20 Torx screws
3. Locate the failed motor — follow the wiring from the connector
4. Disconnect the motor electrical connector
5. Remove the mounting bolts (typically 10mm, **torque: 9 Nm / 7 ft-lbs** for reinstall)
6. Disengage the motor from the drive mechanism (gear or cable)
7. Install the new motor in reverse order
8. Reconnect the 12V battery
9. **Recalibrate the seat** via touchscreen: Controls > Service > Seat Calibration (if available)

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $200–400 | $200–400 | $400–800 |
| Independent Shop | $150–300 | $100–200 | $250–500 |
| DIY | $80–200 | Your time | $80–200 |

**Your savings: $170–600**

## Common Issues by Model

**Model 3 (2018–2020):**
- Seat track motor failure is the most common — forward/back movement stops working
- Often preceded by a clicking or grinding noise

**Model Y:**
- Similar to Model 3, shares most seat components
- Lumbar support motor failures reported on early production vehicles

**Model S/X:**
- More complex seats with more motors to fail
- Head restraint motor is a common failure point
- Memory seat positions may be lost — reconfigure in the driver profile after repair

## Prevention Tips

- **Don't force the seat** if you feel resistance — there may be an obstruction under the seat
- **Keep the seat tracks clean** — debris causes premature motor wear
- **Avoid frequently adjusting** when the car is off (12V power may be limited)
- **Check for items under the seat** — kids' toys, water bottles, and coins are common culprits
