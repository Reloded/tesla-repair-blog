Brake fluid is one of the most overlooked maintenance items on any car—including Teslas. Even though your Tesla's regenerative braking means the hydraulic brakes get less use, the fluid still degrades over time. Here's how to change it yourself.

<div class="tldr-box">
<strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Tesla recommends brake fluid replacement every 2 years (4 years for some markets). Use DOT 4 brake fluid only. The bleeding sequence is: right rear → left rear → right front → left front. Budget 1-2 hours and about €20-40 in supplies.
</div>

## Why Change Brake Fluid?

Brake fluid is **hygroscopic**—it absorbs moisture from the air over time. This causes two problems:

1. **Lower boiling point:** Fresh DOT 4 fluid boils at 230°C+ (446°F). Moisture-contaminated fluid can boil at 155°C (311°F) or lower. Boiling brake fluid creates air bubbles, leading to a soft pedal and reduced braking power.

2. **Internal corrosion:** Water in the brake system causes rust on internal components—calipers, brake lines, and the ABS module.

Even if you rarely use your friction brakes thanks to regen, the fluid is still absorbing moisture and aging.

## When to Change Tesla Brake Fluid

**Tesla's recommendation:** Every 2 years for most markets. Some regions specify 4 years.

**Signs it's overdue:**
- Brake fluid looks dark brown or black (fresh fluid is clear/amber)
- Soft or spongy brake pedal
- It's been 3+ years since last change
- Moisture test strips show >3% water content

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can test brake fluid moisture with inexpensive test strips (~€5). If moisture content is above 3%, it's time to flush regardless of age.
</div>

## What Brake Fluid Does Tesla Use?

Tesla specifies **DOT 4 brake fluid** for all models. Do NOT use:
- DOT 3 (lower boiling point)
- DOT 5 (silicone-based, incompatible)
- DOT 5.1 (technically compatible but unnecessary)

**Recommended brands:**
- **Bosch ENV4** - OEM equivalent, excellent wet boiling point
- **ATE Typ 200** - Popular in Europe, gold-colored
- **Motul DOT 4** - Racing-proven, high boiling point
- **Castrol React DOT 4** - Widely available

You'll need approximately **500ml-1L** for a complete flush (all four corners).

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours  
**Skill Level:** Intermediate  
**Cost:** €20-40 for fluid and supplies

**Essential:**
- 1L DOT 4 brake fluid
- 11mm wrench (for bleeder valves)
- Clear plastic tubing (~30cm per wheel)
- Catch container
- Turkey baster or syringe (to remove old fluid from reservoir)
- Nitrile gloves (brake fluid damages skin and paint)
- Shop towels

**Helpful:**
- One-person brake bleeder kit (vacuum or pressure type)
- Floor jack and jack stands
- Helper to pump the brake pedal

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> Brake fluid is extremely corrosive to paint. If you spill any on your Tesla's body, flush immediately with water. Work carefully around the frunk area.
</div>

## Preparation

Before starting:

1. **Park on a flat surface** and engage Park
2. **Clean around the brake fluid reservoir** - debris can fall in when you open it
3. **Open the frunk** - the reservoir is located in the front
4. **Put the car in Jack Mode**: Controls → Service → Jack Mode
5. **Gather all tools** and have plenty of fresh fluid ready

### Locating the Brake Fluid Reservoir

**Model 3/Y:** In the frunk, driver's side, near the firewall. Black cap marked "DOT 4 BRAKE FLUID."

**Model S/X:** In the frunk, driver's side. On Model S, it's partially covered by trim.

## Step-by-Step Brake Fluid Flush

### Step 1: Remove Old Fluid from Reservoir

1. Open the brake fluid reservoir cap
2. Use a turkey baster or syringe to extract the old fluid from the reservoir
3. Remove as much as possible without letting it run dry
4. Dispose of old fluid properly (take to hazardous waste collection)

**Do NOT let the reservoir go completely empty** during this process—air in the master cylinder creates a massive bleeding headache.

### Step 2: Add Fresh Fluid

1. Fill the reservoir with fresh DOT 4 fluid to the MAX line
2. Keep the bottle handy—you'll need to top up during bleeding

### Step 3: Bleeding Sequence

The correct bleeding order for Tesla is:

1. **Right Rear** (furthest from master cylinder)
2. **Left Rear**
3. **Right Front**
4. **Left Front** (closest to master cylinder)

This ensures you push old fluid out from the furthest point first.

### Step 4: Bleed Each Wheel

For each wheel:

1. **Raise the car** and secure on jack stands (or use a lift)
2. **Remove the wheel** for easier access
3. **Locate the bleeder valve** on the brake caliper—it's a small nipple with a rubber cap
4. **Remove the rubber cap** and clean around the valve
5. **Attach clear tubing** to the bleeder valve, with the other end in your catch bottle
6. **Open the bleeder valve** about 1/4 turn with your 11mm wrench

**Two-person method:**
- Have a helper pump the brake pedal 3-4 times, then hold it down
- While they hold it, crack open the bleeder valve—fluid will squirt out
- Close the valve, then have them pump again
- Repeat until you see only clean, clear fluid with no bubbles

**One-person method (vacuum bleeder):**
- Attach the vacuum bleeder to the nipple
- Pump to create suction
- Open the bleeder valve slightly
- Watch fluid flow through the tube until clean
- Keep reservoir topped up!

### Step 5: Check Fluid Level After Each Wheel

This is critical. After bleeding each corner:
- Check the reservoir level
- Top up to MAX if needed
- Never let it drop below MIN

### Step 6: Final Steps

1. **Pump the brake pedal** several times—it should feel firm
2. **Check for leaks** around all bleeder valves
3. **Replace bleeder valve caps**
4. **Top up reservoir** to between MIN and MAX
5. **Clean any spilled fluid** immediately
6. **Replace wheels** and torque lug nuts
7. **Exit Jack Mode**
8. **Test drive carefully**—brake gently at first to confirm everything works

## Troubleshooting

**Spongy pedal after bleeding:**
- Air is still in the system. Re-bleed starting from the furthest wheel.
- Check that bleeder valves are fully closed.
- Make sure reservoir didn't run dry during bleeding.

**Brake pedal goes to floor:**
- Air in the master cylinder. You may need to bench bleed or have Tesla service it.
- Very rare if you kept reservoir topped up.

**Fluid won't flow from bleeder:**
- Bleeder valve may be clogged. Try gentle pressure or careful application of heat.
- Check that reservoir is full.

## How Often Should You Do This?

| Condition | Interval |
|-----------|----------|
| Normal use | Every 2 years |
| Humid climate | Every 2 years (moisture absorption faster) |
| Track use | Every year or before track days |
| Very low mileage | Every 4 years minimum |

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost |
|--------|------|
| DIY (this guide) | €20-40 |
| Tesla Service Center | €150-250+ |
| Independent shop | €80-150 |

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I just top up the fluid instead of flushing?**  
A: Topping up doesn't remove contaminated fluid. A proper flush replaces all the old fluid in the lines, calipers, and ABS module.

**Q: Do I need to put the car in any special mode?**  
A: Jack Mode prevents the car from auto-leveling (air suspension models) and going to sleep. Not strictly required for bleeding but recommended.

**Q: Will this trigger any warnings?**  
A: No. Unlike some brake work, a fluid flush doesn't require Tesla software to reset anything.

**Q: Can I mix DOT 4 brands?**  
A: Yes, all DOT 4 fluids are compatible. Mixing is fine.

## What About the ABS Module?

A standard 4-corner bleed will replace about 80-90% of the fluid in your system. Some fluid remains in the ABS module and associated lines.

For a **complete** 100% flush, Tesla uses a scan tool to cycle the ABS valves while bleeding. This is overkill for normal maintenance. The DIY method described here is sufficient for routine 2-year intervals.
