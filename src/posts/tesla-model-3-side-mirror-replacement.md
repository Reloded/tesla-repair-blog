Side mirror damage is one of the most common Tesla repairs—whether from a parking mishap, passing cyclist, or road debris. Tesla service centers charge €400-600+ for mirror replacement, but with some patience you can do it yourself for just the cost of the part (€150-300 depending on source).

This guide covers the complete process for 2017-2023 Model 3. Note: Tesla's official procedure involves full door trim panel removal, but many DIYers access the mirror through just the A-pillar area. We'll cover the simplified approach here—for full door panel removal, consult the Tesla Service Manual.

## When to Replace vs. Repair

Before ordering a new mirror assembly, assess the damage:

- **Mirror glass only cracked:** Just the glass insert can be replaced (€30-50, pops out)
- **Mirror cap/cover damaged:** Caps are replaceable separately (€50-80)
- **Turn signal not working:** Often just the bulb or connector
- **Motor/adjustment broken:** Usually requires full assembly replacement
- **Housing cracked or mounting broken:** Full assembly replacement needed

This guide covers **full mirror assembly replacement**—the most common repair after collision damage.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Camera Warning:</strong> Model 3 mirrors contain the Autopilot repeater cameras. After replacement, the cameras may need calibration via Service Mode or a Tesla service center. Watch for "Camera calibration in progress" messages.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Firmware Note:</strong> Newer mirror assemblies (2024+) require vehicle firmware version <strong>2025.2.3 or later</strong> to prevent accelerated wear on the mirror actuator motor. Check your software version before installing new mirrors.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time:** 30-45 minutes per side

**Parts:**
- Replacement mirror assembly (must match side: LH/RH)
- Ensure it matches your car's features (heated, auto-dim, camera)

**Tools:**
- T30 Torx screwdriver (for A-pillar trim)
- 10mm socket and ratchet (mirror mounting bolts)
- Plastic pry tools (essential—metal tools will scratch trim)
- Microfiber cloth (protect interior surfaces)
- Painter's tape (optional, protects paint around work area)

## Step 1: Remove the A-Pillar Trim

The mirror bolts are hidden behind the A-pillar interior trim. This is the most delicate part of the job.

**1.1** Open the front door fully. The A-pillar trim is the triangular piece where the mirror meets the windshield inside the car.

**1.2** Locate the T30 Torx screw securing the A-pillar trim (on premium audio equipped vehicles).

![T30 Torx screwdriver on Tesla interior trim](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/08-completed-mirror.jpg)
*T30 Torx is used for various Tesla interior trim fasteners. For A-pillar trim, the screw may be hidden under a small cover near the door seal.*

**1.3** After removing the screw, the trim is held by plastic clips. Start at the bottom edge and carefully pry outward with a plastic tool.

**1.4** Work your way up, releasing each clip. There are typically 3-4 clips. **Go slowly**—rushed prying breaks clips.

**1.5** Once loose, don't pull the trim away completely. On premium audio vehicles, there's a tweeter speaker connected to the back. Disconnect the speaker connector (small, single connector) and set the trim aside safely.

## Step 2: Disconnect Mirror Wiring

With the trim removed, you'll see the mirror's wiring harness running into the door frame.

![Door interior showing wiring and access area](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/02-mirror-bracket-access.jpg)
*A-pillar area exposed, showing the mirror mounting location and wiring routing through the door frame.*

**2.1** Locate the connectors for the mirror harness. The Model 3 uses FAKRA-style connectors:
- **Pink/Magenta connector:** Repeater camera (Autopilot)
- **Blue connector:** Mirror power, heating, turn signal, adjustment motors

**2.2** To disconnect FAKRA connectors: press the release tab and pull straight out. Don't twist or you'll damage the connector.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Take a photo of the connector arrangement before disconnecting. FAKRA connectors are color-coded, but a reference photo helps during reassembly.
</div>

**2.3** Feed the wiring harness out through the door frame as you remove the mirror.

## Step 3: Remove Mirror Mounting Bolts

![Mirror bracket showing three mounting bolts](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/01-old-new-mirrors.jpg)
*Back of the mirror assembly showing the three hex mounting bolts. Note the bolt pattern and bracket design.*

**3.1** Locate the three 10mm hex bolts holding the mirror bracket to the door. The foremost bolt may be partially hidden under the glass run seal—peel it back gently.

**3.2** Support the mirror with one hand while removing bolts—don't let it fall and scratch the paint.

**3.3** Remove all three bolts, release the wiring clip, and carefully lift the mirror away from the door.

*View inside the door panel showing the wiring harness routing and sound deadening material. The mirror harness routes through this area.*

## Step 4: Install New Mirror

**4.1** Test-fit the new mirror before fully installing. Verify:
- Correct side (driver/passenger)
- Connector types match
- Color match (or plan to swap caps)

**4.2** Position the new mirror and hand-thread all three bolts before tightening.

**4.3** Tighten bolts in a star/cross pattern to **15 Nm (11.1 ft-lb)**. Use hand tools only—do not use impact drivers.

**4.4** Route the wiring harness back through the door frame opening.

**4.5** Reconnect FAKRA connectors:
- Pink → Camera
- Blue → Main harness
- Match any additional connectors to your reference photo

## Step 5: Reinstall A-Pillar Trim

![Mirror installed on door](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/06-mirror-with-trim.jpg)
*New mirror mounted on the door. The triangular A-pillar trim area is visible before reinstallation.*

**5.1** Reconnect the tweeter speaker connector (if equipped with premium audio).

**5.2** Align the trim piece at the top first, then press the clips back into place working downward.

**5.3** Press firmly on each clip location until you hear/feel it snap in.

**5.4** Reinstall the T30 Torx screw to secure the trim.

## Step 6: Test Everything

Before calling it done, verify all functions:

- [ ] Mirror adjustment (all directions)
- [ ] Mirror folding (if equipped)
- [ ] Heated mirrors (enable in climate settings)
- [ ] Turn signal in mirror
- [ ] Autopilot camera (check for calibration message on screen)

The mirror should sit flush with the door and match the body lines. Check that there are no gaps around the base.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Camera Calibration:</strong> If you see "Cameras calibrating" after driving, this is normal. Drive on well-marked roads for 20-100 km until calibration completes. If calibration fails, you may need Tesla service to reset it.
</div>

## Troubleshooting

**Mirror doesn't adjust:**
- Check blue FAKRA connector is fully seated
- Verify connector pins aren't bent
- Try toggling the mirror selector (L/R) on the screen
- **If replacing due to motor short:** Reset the body controller in Service Mode: `Low Voltage > Power Distribution > Reset VCLeft` (or `VCRight` for passenger side)

**Turn signal doesn't work:**
- Same connector as adjustment—recheck connection
- Could be a fuse issue if both mirrors affected

**Camera shows black/errors:**
- Pink FAKRA connector issue—reseat it
- May need calibration drive
- Worst case: Tesla service calibration (~€50-100)

**Mirror vibrates at speed:**
- Mounting bolts not tight enough
- Bracket may be damaged—inspect for cracks
