Side mirror damage is one of the most common Tesla repairs—whether from a parking mishap, passing cyclist, or road debris. Tesla service centers charge €400-600+ for mirror replacement, but with some patience you can do it yourself for just the cost of the part (€150-300 depending on source).

This guide covers the complete process for 2017-2023 Model 3. Note: Tesla's official procedure involves full door trim panel removal, but many DIYers access the mirror through just the A-pillar area. We'll cover the simplified approach here—for full door panel removal, consult the Tesla Service Manual.

## When to Replace vs. Repair

Before ordering a new mirror assembly, assess the damage:

- **Mirror glass only cracked:** Just the glass insert can be replaced (€30-50, pops out)
- **Mirror cap/cover damaged:** Caps are replaceable separately (€50-80)
- **Motor/adjustment broken:** Usually requires full assembly replacement
- **Housing cracked or mounting broken:** Full assembly replacement needed

This guide covers **full mirror assembly replacement**—the most common repair after collision damage.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Firmware Note:</strong> Newer mirror assemblies (2024+) require vehicle firmware version <strong>2025.2.3 or later</strong> to prevent accelerated wear on the mirror actuator motor. Check your software version before installing new mirrors.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time:** 30-45 minutes per side

**Parts:**
- Replacement mirror assembly (must match side: LH/RH)
- Ensure it matches your car's features (heated, auto-dim, folding)

**Tools:**
- T30 Torx screwdriver (for door trim screws)
- 10mm socket and ratchet (mirror mounting bolts)
- Plastic pry tools (essential—metal tools will scratch trim)
- Microfiber cloth (protect interior surfaces)

## Step 1: Access the Mirror Mounting Area

The mirror bolts are accessible from inside the door. You'll need to remove the door panel or access through the A-pillar area.

**1.1** Open the front door fully and lower the window.

**1.2** Remove the door panel or A-pillar trim to access the mirror mounting area. Use plastic pry tools to avoid scratching.

*Mirror mounting bracket exposed on the door. The three bolt holes and wiring grommet are visible. Note the triangular A-pillar trim area above.*

**1.3** On premium audio vehicles, disconnect the tweeter speaker connector before fully removing trim pieces.

## Step 2: Disconnect Mirror Wiring

With the mounting area exposed, you'll see the mirror's wiring harness with multiple connectors.

![FAKRA connectors for mirror - pink, beige, and blue](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/05-fakra-connectors.jpg)
*Mirror connectors: Pink and beige are FAKRA-style connectors, blue is the main mirror harness connector. The "EU/AP PREM" label indicates European market with Premium Connectivity.*

**2.1** Locate the connectors:
- **Pink FAKRA connector:** Data/signals
- **Beige/Tan FAKRA connector:** Additional signals
- **Blue connector:** Main mirror power (heating, adjustment motors)

**2.2** To disconnect: press the release tab and pull straight out. Don't twist or you'll damage the pins.

*Wider view of door interior with connectors disconnected. You can see the speaker (bottom left) and the wiring routing through the door.*

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Take a photo of the connector arrangement before disconnecting. The colors help, but a reference photo makes reassembly easier.
</div>

**2.3** Push the wiring grommet through the door opening to free the harness.

## Step 3: Remove Mirror Mounting Bolts

![Back of mirror showing three 10mm mounting bolts](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/03-mirror-bracket-bolts.jpg)
*Back of the mirror assembly showing the three 10mm hex mounting bolts. These secure the mirror bracket to the door.*

**3.1** Locate the three 10mm hex bolts holding the mirror to the door. The foremost bolt may be partially hidden under the glass run seal—peel it back gently.

![Mirror in position showing bolts and harness routing](/images/repairs/model-3-mirror/04-mirror-bolts-harness.jpg)
*Mirror mounted on door showing the three bolt positions and harness routing. Note the "EU/AP PREM" label on the wiring harness and the grommet where wires pass through.*

**3.2** Support the mirror with one hand while removing bolts—don't let it fall and scratch the paint.

**3.3** Remove all three bolts and carefully lift the mirror away from the door, guiding the harness through the opening.

## Step 4: Install New Mirror

**4.1** Test-fit the new mirror before fully installing. Verify:
- Correct side (driver/passenger)
- Connector types match your vehicle
- Color match (or plan to swap caps from old mirror)

**4.2** Route the wiring harness through the door opening first, then position the mirror.

**4.3** Hand-thread all three bolts before tightening to ensure proper alignment.

**4.4** Tighten bolts in a star/cross pattern to **15 Nm (11.1 ft-lb)**. Use hand tools only—do not use impact drivers.

**4.5** Reconnect all connectors:
- Pink FAKRA → Pink port
- Beige FAKRA → Beige port
- Blue connector → Blue port

Ensure each connector clicks fully into place.

## Step 5: Reinstall Trim and Test

**5.1** Reconnect the tweeter speaker connector (if equipped with premium audio).

**5.2** Reinstall the door panel or A-pillar trim, pressing firmly on clip locations until they snap in.

**5.3** Reinstall any T30 Torx screws that secure the trim.

*Completed installation. The new mirror sits flush with the door and matches the body lines perfectly.*

## Step 6: Verify All Functions

Before calling it done, test everything:

- [ ] Mirror adjustment (all directions via touchscreen)
- [ ] Mirror folding (if equipped)
- [ ] Heated mirrors (enable in climate settings)
- [ ] No warning messages on screen

The mirror should sit flush with the door with no gaps around the base.

## Troubleshooting

**Mirror doesn't adjust:**
- Check connectors are fully seated
- Verify connector pins aren't bent
- Try toggling the mirror selector (L/R) on the touchscreen
- **If replacing due to motor short:** Reset the body controller in Service Mode: `Low Voltage > Power Distribution > Reset VCLeft` (or `VCRight` for passenger side)

**Mirror vibrates at speed:**
- Mounting bolts not tight enough (should be 15 Nm)
- Bracket may be damaged—inspect for cracks

**Connectors won't click in:**
- Check for debris in the connector
- Ensure correct orientation (colors should match)

<strong>Color Matching:</strong> If you can't find a mirror in your exact color, you can swap the mirror cap from your old mirror to the new one. Caps pop off with careful prying from the bottom edge.
