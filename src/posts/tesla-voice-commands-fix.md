Tesla's voice command system lets you control navigation, climate, calls, and more without touching the screen. When it stops working or misunderstands commands, these troubleshooting steps usually resolve the issue.

## Common Voice Command Problems

- **"Voice command unavailable"** message
- **System doesn't respond** to voice button
- **Commands misunderstood** or wrong action taken
- **Partial responses** - starts then stops
- **No audio feedback** from the system

## Quick Fixes

### Check Basic Requirements

Voice commands need:

- **Data connection** (cellular or WiFi)
- **Microphone working** properly
- **Correct language** settings
- **Screen awake** and responsive

### Restart the System

A reboot often fixes voice issues:

1. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. Wait for full restart
3. Try voice commands again

## Microphone Troubleshooting

Tesla has multiple microphones for voice pickup.

### Microphone Locations

- **Model 3/Y:** Above rearview mirror area
- **Model S/X:** Multiple locations in cabin
- **All models:** Additional mics for noise cancellation

### Testing Microphones

1. Make a hands-free phone call
2. Ask passenger if they can hear you clearly
3. Record a voice note on your phone for comparison
4. If calls work but commands don't, it's software not hardware

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Clean around the headliner area above the mirror monthly. Dust buildup can affect microphone pickup.
</div>

## Background Noise Issues

Voice recognition struggles with:

- **Wind noise** from open windows
- **Loud music** playing
- **HVAC on high** fan speed
- **Road noise** from tires
- **Passengers talking** simultaneously

### Improving Recognition

1. Close windows before speaking
2. Lower music volume automatically (Tesla does this)
3. Reduce fan speed temporarily
4. Speak clearly toward the mirror area
5. Wait for the beep before speaking

## Language Settings

### Check Language Configuration

1. Go to **Controls > Display**
2. Find **Language** settings
3. Verify your preferred language is selected
4. Voice and display language should match

### Regional Variants

Tesla supports different English variants:

- US English
- UK English
- Australian English

Mismatched accent settings can reduce accuracy.

## Using Voice Commands Correctly

### Activation Methods

- **Steering wheel button:** Press right scroll wheel
- **Voice wake word:** "Hey Tesla" (if enabled)
- **Touchscreen microphone** icon

### Command Structure

Speak naturally but clearly:

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Effective Commands:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Navigate to [destination]"</li>
<li>"Set temperature to 22 degrees"</li>
<li>"Call [contact name]"</li>
<li>"Play [song/artist/playlist]"</li>
<li>"Open charge port"</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Available Voice Commands

- "Stop navigation"
- "Show Superchargers"

**Climate:**

**Information:**

- "What's the weather?"
- "Bug report [description]"

## "Hey Tesla" Wake Word

If wake word isn't responding:

1. Go to **Controls > Voice**
2. Enable **"Hey Tesla"** wake word
3. Test in a quiet environment
4. Speak clearly: "Hey Tesla"
5. Wait for the beep before continuing

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Wake word uses more battery due to always-listening. Some owners disable it to reduce vampire drain.
</div>

## Software Updates

Voice recognition improves with updates:

- Tesla regularly updates voice AI
- New commands added over time
- Check release notes for voice improvements
- Report issues via "Bug report" voice command

## When to Contact Service

Reach out to Tesla if:

- Microphones don't work for calls either
- Voice commands worked then completely stopped
- Error messages appear about audio hardware
- Multiple reboots don't resolve the issue

Hardware microphone failure is rare but possible, especially after water intrusion or physical damage.
