Proper wheel alignment is crucial for tire longevity, handling, and efficiency in your Tesla. While professional alignment is recommended, DIY checking and basic adjustments are possible with the right tools and patience. This guide explains alignment fundamentals and what you can realistically accomplish at home.

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Professional alignment with modern equipment is strongly recommended for accurate results. DIY methods are useful for checking alignment and making rough adjustments but can't match professional precision.
</div>

## Understanding Wheel Alignment

Wheel alignment involves three main angles:

### Camber
- **What it is:** Vertical tilt of the wheel when viewed from the front
- **Negative camber:** Top of wheel tilts inward
- **Positive camber:** Top of wheel tilts outward
- **Tesla spec:** Typically -0.5 to -1.5 degrees

### Toe
- **What it is:** Direction wheels point relative to centerline
- **Toe-in:** Front of wheels point toward each other
- **Toe-out:** Front of wheels point away from each other
- **Tesla spec:** Near zero (0 to 0.1 degrees)

### Caster
- **What it is:** Angle of steering axis when viewed from the side
- **Affects:** Steering feel and straight-line stability
- **Tesla spec:** Fixed by design, not adjustable

## Signs Your Tesla Needs Alignment

- Uneven tire wear (inside or outside edge worn)
- Vehicle pulls to one side
- Steering wheel off-center when driving straight
- Reduced range (due to increased rolling resistance)
- Car feels unstable or wanders

## DIY Alignment Check Methods

### Method 1: String Alignment (Checking Toe)

This classic method checks if all four wheels are parallel:

**Materials needed:**
- 4 jack stands
- String or fishing line
- Tape measure
- Level ground

**Steps:**
1. Park on level ground with steering centered
2. Place jack stands at each corner, away from wheels
3. Run string along both sides of car, parallel to body
4. Measure distance from string to front and rear of each wheel
5. Compare front vs rear measurements—should be equal for zero toe

**Interpreting results:**
- Front measurement smaller = toe-in
- Front measurement larger = toe-out
- Difference of more than 3mm indicates adjustment needed

### Method 2: Camber Check with Digital Level

**Steps:**
1. Park on level ground
2. Place digital angle gauge vertically against wheel rim
3. Read the angle displayed
4. Compare to specifications (-0.5 to -1.5 degrees typical)
5. Check all four wheels

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> For accurate camber readings, make sure tires are properly inflated and the car is at normal ride height. Avoid measuring with passengers or cargo.
</div>

### Method 3: Tire Wear Inspection

Your tires tell the alignment story:

- **Inside edge wear:** Too much negative camber
- **Outside edge wear:** Too much positive camber (rare)
- **Feathered edge (one direction):** Toe misalignment
- **Center wear:** Overinflation
- **Edge wear (both sides):** Underinflation

## Tesla Alignment Specifications

Typical specifications (verify for your specific model year):

**Model 3/Y Front:**
- Camber: -0.5° to -1.0°
- Toe: 0.0° to 0.1° (per side)

**Model 3/Y Rear:**
- Camber: -1.0° to -1.5°
- Toe: 0.1° to 0.2° (per side)

**Model S/X specifications vary by year and suspension type**

## Adjustable Components on Tesla

### What You CAN Adjust DIY (with proper tools):

**Rear toe (Model 3/Y):**
- Adjustable via eccentric bolts on rear lower control arm
- Requires 18mm wrench
- Small adjustments possible

**Front toe (limited):**
- Tie rod adjustment (inner tie rod)
- Requires special tools
- Affects steering wheel position

### What Requires Professional Equipment:

- Front camber (requires camber arms or subframe adjustment)
- Rear camber (mostly fixed on Model 3/Y)
- Caster (not adjustable)
- Precise measurements within 0.1 degree

## Basic DIY Toe Adjustment (Rear)

If your check shows rear toe is out of spec:

**Step 1: Locate adjustment point**
- Rear lower control arm has eccentric bolt
- Bolt head has offset washer

**Step 2: Loosen and adjust**
1. Loosen the nut (18mm) without removing
2. Rotate the bolt head to move wheel angle
3. Small rotation = small toe change
4. Retighten to specification

**Step 3: Verify**
- Repeat string alignment check
- Adjust other side if needed
- Both sides should be close to equal

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Improper adjustment can cause dangerous handling. If unsure, have a professional complete the alignment.
</div>

## When to Get Professional Alignment

**Definitely visit a shop if:**
- You've hit a pothole or curb significantly
- After any suspension work (control arms, struts, etc.)
- After lowering or raising the car
- Tire wear is severe or unusual
- DIY check shows significant misalignment
- You want precise, documented results

## Professional Alignment Cost

| Service | Typical Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| 2-wheel alignment | €80-120 |
| 4-wheel alignment | €120-180 |
| Performance alignment | €150-250 |
| Tesla Service Center | €200-300 |

Many independent shops with modern equipment can align Teslas. Request printout of before/after measurements.

## Maintaining Good Alignment

- **Check tire pressure regularly** - affects ride height and wear
- **Inspect after impacts** - potholes, curbs, debris
- **Rotate tires** - helps identify alignment wear patterns early
- **Annual alignment check** - even without symptoms
- **Use quality tires** - better tires show alignment issues more clearly

## DIY Alignment Tools Worth Having

For enthusiasts who want to monitor alignment:

1. **Digital angle gauge** - quick camber checks
2. **Tape measure** - string alignment method
3. **Toe plates** - more accurate than string alone
4. **Torque wrench** - proper fastener tightening
5. **Jack and stands** - safe elevation when needed

*DIY alignment checking is valuable for catching problems early. For actual adjustments, most Tesla owners benefit from professional service with modern computerized equipment that ensures precise results.*
