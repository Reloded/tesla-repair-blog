Tesla vehicles receive regular over-the-air updates, but sometimes these updates get stuck or fail to install. This guide walks you through troubleshooting steps to get your update completed successfully.

## Common Update Problems

Before troubleshooting, identify your issue:

- **Update won't download** - Stuck at 0% or shows error
- **Download incomplete** - Progress stuck at certain percentage
- **Installation failed** - Download completed but won't install
- **Update keeps restarting** - Loops without finishing
- **No update available** - Expected update not showing

## Step 1: Check WiFi Connection

Most update problems are WiFi-related. Tesla strongly prefers WiFi over cellular for updates.

### Verify Connection

1. Go to **Controls > WiFi**
2. Confirm you're connected to a network
3. Check signal strength (should be strong)
4. Run a speed test on your phone while near the car

### WiFi Requirements

- **Minimum speed:** 10 Mbps recommended
- **Stable connection:** Updates fail with intermittent WiFi
- **No captive portals:** Hotel/airport WiFi often won't work
- **2.4 GHz or 5 GHz:** Both work, but 2.4 GHz has better range

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If your garage has weak WiFi, try parking closer to your router or using a WiFi extender. Some owners use a mobile hotspot for updates.

## Step 2: Reset WiFi Connection

If WiFi shows connected but updates won't download:

1. Go to **Controls > WiFi**
2. Tap your connected network
3. Select **Forget Network**
4. Restart the car (hold both scroll wheels 10 seconds)
5. Reconnect to WiFi after reboot
6. Try the update again

## Step 3: Perform System Reboot

A soft reboot can clear update glitches:

**Soft Reboot:**
1. Park safely
2. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
3. Screen goes dark and Tesla logo appears
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for full restart
5. Check for update in **Controls > Software**

**Power Cycle (for persistent issues):**
1. Go to **Controls > Safety > Power Off**
2. Wait 3 minutes without touching anything
3. Press brake pedal to wake the car
4. Check for update

## Step 4: Ensure Proper Conditions

Updates require specific conditions:

### Before Downloading
- **WiFi connected** with good signal
- **Battery above 20%** (50%+ recommended)
- **Park in range** of your WiFi network

### Before Installing
- **Car in Park**
- **Not charging** (some updates require this)
- **Climate off** may help
- **All doors closed**

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Never try to drive during an update installation. The car will prevent this, but attempting to interrupt can cause issues.
</div>

## Step 5: Schedule Installation

If downloads complete but installation fails:

1. Go to **Controls > Software**
2. Don't select "Install Now"
3. Choose **Schedule** and pick a time
4. Ensure car will be parked with good WiFi
5. Leave car alone during scheduled time

Scheduled installations often work better than immediate ones.

## Step 6: Clear Update Cache

For repeatedly failing updates:

1. Go to **Controls > Service > Software**
2. If available, select **Clear Update**
3. This removes the corrupted download
4. Re-download the update from scratch
5. Be patient - large updates take 30-60 minutes to download

## Mobile Hotspot Alternative

If home WiFi isn't working:

1. Enable hotspot on your phone
2. Connect Tesla to phone's hotspot
3. Ensure unlimited data plan (updates can be 2-5 GB)
4. Stay near the car during download
5. Keep phone plugged in to prevent it from sleeping

## Manual Update Request

If no update appears but you know one exists:

1. Open the Tesla app
2. Go to **Service > Request Update**
3. Some regions have this option
4. Updates rollout in waves - patience may be needed

## Checking Update Rollout Status

Tesla releases updates gradually:

- **Early access users** get updates first
- **Geographic rollouts** vary by region
- **Vehicle-specific updates** - not all cars get same version
- **Check TeslaFi** or **Not a Tesla App** for community tracking

## When to Contact Tesla Service

Reach out to Tesla if:

- Updates fail repeatedly after all troubleshooting
- You see error messages about update failures
- Car behaves abnormally after partial update
- "Service required" messages appear
- Other owners with same car received update weeks ago

### Service Appointment

Tesla can:
- Force push specific updates
- Diagnose connectivity hardware
- Reset update systems remotely
- Install updates via service mode
