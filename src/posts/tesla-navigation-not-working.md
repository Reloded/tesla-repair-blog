Tesla's navigation system is generally reliable, but issues can occur with map loading, GPS signals, or route calculations. This guide covers the most common navigation problems and their solutions.

## Common Navigation Issues

Identify your specific problem:

- **Maps won't load** - Blank or grey map display
- **GPS signal lost** - Location not updating
- **Routes not calculating** - Can't find destinations
- **Wrong directions** - Outdated or incorrect routing
- **Traffic not showing** - No real-time data

## Quick Fixes

### Reboot the System

Most navigation glitches clear with a reboot:

1. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
2. Wait for screen to restart
3. Give maps 2-3 minutes to reload
4. Check if navigation works

### Check Connectivity

Navigation requires data connection:

- **Standard Connectivity:** Uses WiFi only
- **Premium Connectivity:** Uses cellular LTE

Without connectivity, you'll only see cached maps.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Connect to WiFi before trips to cache map data for your route. This helps in areas with poor cellular coverage.
</div>

## Maps Won't Load

### Blank Map Display

If maps show grey or won't render:

1. **Check Premium Connectivity** subscription status
2. **Verify cellular signal** - look at signal bars on screen
3. **Clear map cache:**
   - Go to Controls > Service
   - Select Reset > Clear Browser Cache (if available)
4. **Wait for map tiles** to download - can take several minutes

### Partial Map Loading

If maps load slowly or incompletely:

- Drive to an area with better signal
- Connect to WiFi to pre-cache your route
- Check for software updates that may fix the issue

## GPS Signal Problems

### Location Not Updating

If your position dot doesn't move:

1. **Check for interference:**
   - Parking structures block GPS
   - Dense urban canyons affect signal
   - Some tinted windows can reduce GPS

2. **Restart GPS:**
   - Perform a system reboot
   - Drive to an open area
   - Give the system 5 minutes to acquire satellites

3. **Check antenna:**
   - GPS antenna is in the roof
   - Damage or accessories can interfere

### Wrong Location Shown

If the map shows you in the wrong place:

- Wait 30 seconds for GPS to correct
- Reboot if location doesn't update
- Check for MCU hardware issues if persistent

## Routing Problems

### Can't Find Address

If navigation won't find your destination:

1. **Try different search terms:**
   - Business name vs. street address
   - City, postal code included
   - Nearby landmark instead

2. **Use coordinates:**
   - Enter latitude/longitude directly
   - Format: 48.8566, 2.3522

3. **Share from phone:**
   - Find in Google Maps
   - Share to Tesla app
   - Send to car

### Route Calculation Failed

If routes won't calculate:

- Check internet connectivity
- Try a different destination to test
- Reboot the system
- Wait 10 minutes and retry

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Very long routes (1000+ km) may take longer to calculate or require breaking into segments.
</div>

## Traffic Data Issues

### No Traffic Information

Traffic data requires Premium Connectivity:

1. **Verify subscription:** Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information
2. **Check signal strength** for data connection
3. **Traffic updates periodically** - not always real-time

### Inaccurate Traffic

Tesla uses multiple data sources. If traffic seems wrong:

- Report via voice: "Bug report - traffic data inaccurate"
- Use alternative route if needed
- Update often improves traffic data accuracy

## Satellite View Not Loading

If satellite imagery won't display:

- Requires Premium Connectivity
- Very data-intensive - needs good signal
- Switch to standard map view as alternative
- Connect to WiFi for faster loading

## Premium Connectivity Features

What you get with Premium Connectivity:

| Feature | Standard | Premium |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Navigation | Basic maps (WiFi only) | Live maps + satellite |
| Traffic | No | Real-time |
| Streaming | No | Music, video |
| Browser | No | Full web browser |
| Price | Included | $9.99/month |

## Offline Navigation Tips

If you frequently drive without signal:

1. **Pre-cache routes** while on WiFi
2. **Download offline maps** - not supported natively
3. **Use phone backup** for critical navigation
4. **Note key intersections** before losing signal

## When to Contact Service

Reach out to Tesla if:

- GPS never acquires signal
- Navigation worked, then permanently failed
- Screen shows map errors repeatedly
- Hardware messages appear about GPS/antenna

*Navigation issues are usually connectivity-related. Ensure you have adequate signal or WiFi access, and most problems resolve themselves.*
