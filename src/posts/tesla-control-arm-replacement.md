The front upper control arms are one of the most common wear items on Tesla vehicles, especially Model 3 and Model Y. The factory design uses a ball joint that's prone to water ingress, leading to squeaks, clunks, and eventually play in the suspension. Here's how to diagnose and replace them yourself.

## Symptoms of Worn Control Arms

**Audible Signs:**
- Squeaking over bumps (especially when cold)
- Clunking when turning at low speeds
- Creaking during parking maneuvers
- Noise gets worse in wet weather

**Handling Signs:**
- Vague steering feel
- Wandering at highway speeds
- Uneven tire wear
- Car pulls to one side

**Visual Inspection:**
- Torn or damaged ball joint boot
- Visible rust around ball joint
- Movement when prying with a bar

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>The Squeak Test:</strong> Drive slowly over speed bumps first thing in the morning when the car is cold. If you hear squeaking that goes away after the suspension warms up, your control arm ball joints are likely failing.
</div>

## Why Tesla Control Arms Fail

Tesla's original front upper control arm design has a known weakness:

1. **Water Ingress** - The ball joint boot allows water in
2. **Corrosion** - Water causes internal rust
3. **Lubrication Loss** - Grease washes out or degrades
4. **Metal-on-Metal Contact** - Creates noise and wear

Tesla has revised the design multiple times. Aftermarket options often use greaseable ball joints that can be maintained.

## Parts Options

**OEM Tesla Replacement:**
- Same design as original (may fail again)
- Includes new ball joint boots
- Cost: $150-250 per arm

**Upgraded Aftermarket:**
- Greaseable ball joints (can be maintained)
- Often stronger design
- Cost: $100-200 per arm
- Brands: SPC, Mevotech, Moog

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Always replace control arms in pairs (both left and right). If one has failed, the other is likely close behind. Mismatched suspension components can cause handling issues.

## DIY Replacement Guide

### Tools Required

- Floor jack (3+ ton capacity)
- Jack stands (rated for vehicle weight)
- Ball joint separator or pickle fork
- 18mm socket and wrench
- 21mm socket (lug nuts)
- Torque wrench
- Penetrating oil (PB Blaster)
- Wire brush
- Blue threadlocker

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Park on level ground
2. Loosen front lug nuts (don't remove)
3. Lift the front of the car with floor jack
4. Secure on jack stands under the frame
5. Remove front wheels

### Step 2: Access the Control Arm

1. Locate the upper control arm behind the wheel hub
2. Spray all bolts with penetrating oil
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for oil to work
4. Wire brush any visible rust from bolts

### Step 3: Disconnect the Ball Joint

**Method A: Ball Joint Separator (Recommended)**
1. Remove the pinch bolt securing ball joint to knuckle (18mm)
2. Position ball joint separator between knuckle and control arm
3. Tighten separator until ball joint pops free
4. Remove separator

**Method B: Pickle Fork**
1. Remove pinch bolt
2. Drive pickle fork between knuckle and ball joint
3. Tap with hammer until joint separates
4. Note: May damage boot (fine if replacing anyway)

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Never use a hammer directly on the ball joint stud!</strong> This can damage the steering knuckle threads. Always use proper separation tools.
</div>

### Step 4: Remove the Control Arm

1. Support the knuckle so it doesn't hang by brake line
2. Remove the two bolts at the inner frame mount (18mm)
3. Note the orientation of any alignment cams
4. Remove the control arm

### Step 5: Install New Control Arm

1. Position new control arm in frame mount
2. Hand-thread inner mounting bolts
3. Insert ball joint stud into knuckle
4. Install and hand-tighten pinch bolt
5. Apply threadlocker to bolts if not pre-applied

### Step 6: Torque to Specification

**Torque Values (Model 3/Y):**
- Inner mounting bolts: 150 Nm (111 ft-lb)
- Ball joint pinch bolt: 50 Nm (37 ft-lb)

**Tightening Order:**
1. Torque inner bolts first
2. Then torque pinch bolt
3. Lower car to ground (weight on wheels)
4. Re-check torque values

### Step 7: Repeat for Other Side

Mirror the process for the passenger side.

## Post-Installation

### Wheel Alignment

**Critical:** Control arm replacement changes suspension geometry. You must get a wheel alignment after this repair.

- Drive directly to alignment shop (within 10 miles)
- Expect to pay $80-150 for alignment
- Skipping alignment causes tire wear and poor handling

### Test Drive

After alignment, test drive and check for:
- No clunks or squeaks
- Steering returns to center smoothly
- No pulling to either side
- No unusual vibrations

## Maintenance Tips

**For Greaseable Aftermarket Arms:**
- Apply grease every 10,000 miles
- Use marine-grade grease for water resistance
- Pump until fresh grease exits the boot

**Preventing Future Failure:**
- Wash undercarriage regularly (removes road salt)
- Inspect boots annually for tears
- Address small tears with boot repair tape before water enters

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $300-500 | $400-600 | $700-1,100 |
| Independent Shop | $200-400 | $200-400 | $400-800 |
| DIY (OEM Parts) | $300-500 | Free | $300-500 |
| DIY (Aftermarket) | $200-400 | Free | $200-400 |

**Plus Alignment:** Add $80-150 for wheel alignment (required regardless of who does the work).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not replacing in pairs** - Leads to unbalanced handling
2. **Skipping alignment** - Causes rapid tire wear
3. **Over-torquing bolts** - Can strip threads or crack components
4. **Reusing stretched bolts** - Some bolts are torque-to-yield
5. **Not supporting the knuckle** - Can damage brake lines

*Control arm replacement is one of the more involved DIY repairs, but it's absolutely doable with basic mechanical skills. The key is taking your time, using proper tools, and always getting an alignment afterward.*
