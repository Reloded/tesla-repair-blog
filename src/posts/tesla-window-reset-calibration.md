**Tesla windows sometimes "forget" where they're supposed to stop.** When this happens, they won't fully close, auto-reverse for no reason, or leave gaps that let in wind noise and water. The fix takes 60 seconds per window — no tools, no service appointment.

## Common Tesla Window Problems

Before resetting, identify your specific issue:

- **Window won't fully close** - Stops a few millimeters from the top
- **Auto-reverse when closing** - Window thinks there's an obstruction
- **Gap at the top when door closes** - Window doesn't rise to meet the seal
- **Wind noise at highway speeds** - Poor seal against the frame
- **Water leaks into cabin** - Window not seating properly

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Good News:</strong> Most window issues are solved with a simple recalibration that takes less than 2 minutes per window. No tools required!
</div>

## How to Reset Tesla Window Calibration

This procedure works on all Tesla models. You'll need to do it for each affected window.

### Method 1: Manual Reset (Recommended)

Per [Tesla's official procedure](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Public/diy/model3/en_us/GUID-B6C81FC2-A37C-462B-8A71-FDE0F7B0734E.html):

1. Close the door with the affected window
2. Sit in the driver's seat and close the driver door
3. Using the window switch, **raise the affected window until it stalls**
4. Using the window switch, **lower the affected window until it stalls**
5. **Raise the affected window until it stalls again**

The window should now be calibrated.

**Test the Window:**

1. Use the one-touch auto-close feature (tap up once)
2. The window should close completely without reversing
3. Open and close the door to verify proper seal

If the issue persists after trying this a couple of times, contact Tesla service.

### Method 2: Service Mode Reset

For persistent issues, you can use Service Mode (requires enabling it first):

1. Enable Service Mode on the touchscreen
2. Go to **Controls > Service Mode > Closures > Windows**
3. Tap each window's **Calibrate** button
4. The selected window will roll up and down automatically
5. Exit Service Mode when complete

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Pinch detection is disabled during Service Mode calibration. Method 1 (manual reset) works on all vehicles without needing Service Mode.
</div>

## Why Windows Lose Calibration

Several things can cause calibration to drift:

- **[12V battery](/posts/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/) disconnect or replacement** - Resets the position memory
- **Software updates** - Occasionally reset window parameters
- **Temperature extremes** - Rubber seals expand and contract
- **Dirty window tracks** - Resistance causes the motor to misjudge position
- **Worn seals** - Change the expected stopping point

## Cleaning Window Tracks

If recalibration doesn't fully solve the problem, dirty tracks might be the cause:

1. Lower the window halfway
2. Spray silicone lubricant into the track channel
3. Run the window up and down several times
4. Wipe away excess lubricant
5. Recalibrate using Method 1

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Don't use WD-40</strong> on window tracks. It attracts dust and can damage rubber seals. Use silicone-based lubricant only.
</div>

## Maintaining Window Seals

Healthy seals are essential for proper window operation:

**Every 3-6 months:**
- Clean seals with mild soap and water
- Apply rubber conditioner to keep seals supple
- Check for cracks or tears

**Before winter:**
- Treat seals with silicone spray
- Prevents freezing and sticking
- Reduces strain on window motors

## When to Seek Service

Contact Tesla service if:

- Window motor makes grinding noises
- Window moves very slowly or unevenly
- Calibration doesn't hold after multiple attempts
- Physical damage to the window regulator
- Window falls into the door

## Troubleshooting Specific Issues

### Window Auto-Reverses Immediately

The pinch sensor thinks something is blocking the window:

1. Clean the top edge of the window with glass cleaner
2. Inspect the seal for debris or damage
3. Recalibrate using Method 1
4. If persistent, the pinch sensor may need service

### Gap When Door Closes

Tesla windows drop slightly when the door opens (to clear the frameless seal) and should rise when closed:

1. Verify the door is fully latched
2. Recalibrate the window
3. Check that the door alignment is correct
4. Inspect the rubber seal for compression

### One Window Slower Than Others

Could indicate a failing regulator:

1. Check for debris in the track
2. Lubricate the track
3. If still slow, schedule service before complete failure

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| DIY Calibration | Free | Takes 2 minutes |
| Service Center Calibration | $100-150 | If software reset needed |
| Window Regulator Replacement | $300-500 | Parts + labor |

The DIY calibration fix solves 90% of Tesla window issues at zero cost.

*Window problems are one of the most common Tesla complaints, but they're almost always fixable with a simple recalibration. Try the manual reset before scheduling service!*
