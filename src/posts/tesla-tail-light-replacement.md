faq:
  - q: "Can I just replace the bulb instead of the whole tail light?"
    a: "Tesla tail lights use integrated LEDs that aren't individually replaceable. If an LED fails, you need to replace the entire assembly. The good news is LEDs rarely fail—most replacements are due to physical damage or water intrusion."
  - q: "Why is my tail light filling with condensation?"
    a: "Water intrusion usually means a cracked lens, failed seal, or damaged gasket. Minor condensation can clear on its own, but persistent moisture means the assembly needs replacement to prevent electrical damage."
  - q: "Are aftermarket tail lights as good as OEM?"
    a: "Quality aftermarket options (AlphaRex, T Sportline) work well and may offer different styling. For insurance claims or if you want guaranteed fit, stick with Tesla OEM. Aftermarket lights may trigger warnings if they don't match OEM resistance values."
  - q: "Do I need to code or program the new tail light?"
    a: "No. Tesla tail lights are plug-and-play. Just connect the harness, mount the light, and you're done. No software or calibration required."
  - q: "Can I drive with a broken tail light?"
    a: "Technically yes, but it's illegal in most jurisdictions and unsafe. A missing or non-functional tail light can result in a ticket and makes you less visible to other drivers, especially at night."

Cracked tail light from a parking lot bump? Foggy lens from water intrusion? Replacing a Tesla tail light is easier than you'd think—about 15 minutes and two nuts.

Tesla service centers charge **$400-700** for this repair (part + labor). DIY cost is **$150-400** for the part, and you keep the labor savings.

## When to Replace Your Tail Light

Common reasons for replacement:

- **Cracked lens** — from minor impacts or road debris
- **Water/condensation inside** — seal failure or hairline crack
- **LED failure** — one or more LED segments not illuminating
- **Foggy/yellowed lens** — UV damage over time
- **Accident damage** — insurance claim or out-of-pocket repair

**Note:** Minor external scratches can sometimes be polished out. Only replace if the lens is cracked through, leaking, or LEDs have failed.

## Tools Needed

- **8mm socket** (12-point deep socket works best)
- **Ratchet or socket wrench**
- **Plastic trim tool** (for garnish removal)
- **Bump stop removal tool** (optional—plastic pry tool works)

That's it. No special Tesla tools required.

## Parts: Where to Buy

### OEM Tesla Tail Lights

**Model 3 (2017-2023):**
- Left (Driver): ~$250-350

**Tip:** If filing an insurance claim, use OEM parts. Aftermarket lights may complicate claims.

## Step-by-Step: Model 3/Y Tail Light Replacement

This procedure covers the outer (fender-mounted) tail light. The trunk lid light is similar but accessed differently.

### Step 1: Open the Trunk

1. Open your trunk fully
2. You'll be working from inside the trunk area, looking at the back of the tail light

### Step 2: Remove the Trunk Bumper Stop

On the inside edge of the trunk opening, there's a rubber bumper stop near the tail light.

1. Locate the rubber trunk stop (cylindrical rubber piece)
2. **Tesla specifies a special tool**, but a plastic trim tool works fine:
   - Grip the base of the stop
   - Turn counter-clockwise while pulling out
   - Or gently pry around the base to release it
3. Set aside—you'll reinstall this later

**⚠️ Caution:** Don't use metal tools or excessive force—you can crack the tail light housing.

### Step 3: Remove the Trunk Garnish

The plastic garnish (trim piece) along the trunk opening needs to come off for access.

1. Use a plastic trim tool to release the clips
2. Start from one end and work along the length
3. Pull the garnish away from the body
4. Set aside carefully—the clips can break if forced

### Step 4: Access the Tail Light

1. Pull back the trunk carpet/liner to expose the back of the tail light
2. You'll see:
   - Electrical connector
   - Two mounting nuts

### Step 5: Disconnect the Electrical Connector

1. Locate the electrical connector on the tail light
2. **If it has a red locking tab:**
   - Pull the red tab AWAY from the connector (don't push down)
   - Then pull the connector body straight out
3. **If no red tab:**
   - Press the release clip and pull straight out

**⚠️ Caution:** If replacing due to water intrusion, place a towel under the connector to catch any water and protect other electronics.

### Step 6: Remove the Mounting Nuts

1. Use your 8mm socket (12-point deep socket recommended)
2. Remove both nuts that hold the tail light to the body
3. Keep the nuts safe—you'll reuse them

### Step 7: Remove the Tail Light Assembly

1. From the outside of the car, gently pull the tail light away from the body
2. It may require slight wiggling—there are alignment studs
3. Pull straight back to avoid breaking the studs

### Step 8: Install the New Tail Light

1. **Inspect the new light** — check for shipping damage, verify correct side (LH/RH)

2. **Check the gasket** — the rubber gasket should be in place around the mounting surface. If missing, transfer from old light or order separately.

3. **Position the tail light:**
   - Align the studs with the grommets on the body
   - Press firmly until seated flush

4. **Install mounting nuts:**
   - Thread both nuts by hand first
   - Tighten with 8mm socket
   - Don't overtighten—snug is sufficient

5. **Connect the electrical harness:**
   - Push connector in until it clicks
   - If equipped with red locking tab, push it back into locked position

### Step 9: Reassemble

1. **Test the lights before reassembly:**
   - Turn on headlights — tail lights should illuminate
   - Press brake pedal — brake lights should brighten
   - Activate turn signal — blinker should flash
   - Engage reverse — reverse light should illuminate (if applicable to that unit)

2. **Reinstall trunk carpet/liner**

3. **Reinstall trunk garnish:**
   - Align clips with holes
   - Press firmly along the length until all clips snap in

4. **Reinstall trunk bumper stop:**
   - Push into hole and turn clockwise to lock

5. **Close trunk and inspect** — check that the light sits flush with body panels

## Model S/X Differences

### Model S
- Access is similar but trim pieces differ
- Some years have additional fasteners
- Trunk hinge may limit access—open fully

### Model X
- Rear liftgate lights vs. body-mounted lights
- Falcon wing door area has separate lighting
- Consult your year's service manual for specifics

## Trunk Lid Tail Light (Model 3/Y)

The inner tail light (on the trunk lid itself) is a separate assembly.

**Removal:**
1. Open trunk
2. Remove trunk interior trim/carpet on the lid
3. Disconnect electrical connector
4. Remove mounting fasteners (usually clips or small bolts)
5. Pull light assembly out from the outside

**Installation:** Reverse of removal

## Troubleshooting

**New tail light doesn't work:**
- Check connector is fully seated
- Verify you installed the correct side (LH vs RH)
- Check fuses (owner's manual has locations)
- Try disconnecting 12V battery for 2 minutes, then reconnect

**Light works but shows warning on screen:**
- Some aftermarket lights have different resistance values
- Warning may clear after a drive cycle
- If persistent, check for firmware updates or consider OEM parts

**Light doesn't sit flush:**
- Check that alignment studs are in grommets
- Verify gasket is properly positioned
- Don't force—remove and reseat

**Water still getting in (new light):**
- Verify gasket is present and undamaged
- Check body mounting holes for debris
- May need sealant if body is damaged (rare)

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts | Labor | Total |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $250-400 | $150-200 | **$400-600** |
| Independent Shop | $200-350 | $75-125 | **$275-475** |
| DIY | $150-400 | $0 | **$150-400** |

**Your savings: $125-250** for 15-20 minutes of work.
