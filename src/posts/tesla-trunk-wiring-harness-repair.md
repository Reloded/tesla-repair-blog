faq:
  - q: "Why do Tesla trunk wires break?"
    a: "The wiring harness in the trunk lid flexes every time you open and close the trunk. Over thousands of cycles, the insulation cracks and the copper conductors fatigue and snap. Tesla's original harness routing on 2017-2020 Model 3 was particularly prone to this — Tesla issued recall 21V-00D to address it with a revised harness that has a longer service loop."
  - q: "Is the Tesla trunk harness covered by recall?"
    a: "2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles are covered under Tesla recall 21V-00D for the coaxial cable (backup camera). Tesla will replace the trunk lid harness at no cost. Check your VIN on tesla.com/support or the NHTSA recalls page to confirm eligibility. Model Y and 2021+ Model 3 are not covered by this recall."
  - q: "Can I repair the broken wires instead of replacing the whole harness?"
    a: "Yes. If only one or two wires are broken, you can splice and solder them with heat-shrink tubing. Add extra service loop so the repaired section doesn't flex at the same point. A full harness replacement is more reliable long-term but costs more and takes longer."
  - q: "How much does Tesla charge for trunk harness replacement?"
    a: "If not covered by recall, Tesla typically charges $400-800 for trunk lid harness replacement including labor. The harness itself costs $100-200 from Tesla. DIY replacement or wire repair saves most of that cost."
  - q: "What are the symptoms of a broken trunk wiring harness?"
    a: "Common symptoms include intermittent or dead backup camera, tail lights or brake lights not working, trunk latch issues (trunk won't close or shows open warning), license plate lights out, and rear defroster not working. Symptoms often come and go — they may work when the trunk is at a certain angle but fail when fully open or closed."

Your Tesla's backup camera cuts out randomly. Or the tail lights flicker. Or the trunk shows "open" when it's clearly closed. These symptoms seem unrelated, but they often share one cause: broken wires inside the trunk lid wiring harness.

Every time you open and close your trunk, a bundle of wires flexes at the hinge point. After thousands of cycles, individual conductors fatigue and snap — sometimes inside the insulation where you can't see the break. This is one of the most common electrical issues on the Model 3 and Model Y, and Tesla even issued a recall for early Model 3s.

The good news: you can fix this yourself in an afternoon with basic soldering skills, or replace the entire harness if you want a permanent solution.

## Symptoms of a Failing Trunk Harness

The trunk lid harness carries power and data to every component in the trunk lid:

- **Backup camera** (coaxial cable)
- **Tail lights and brake lights**
- **License plate lights**
- **Trunk latch/lock actuator**
- **Rear window defroster** (Model 3 sedan)
- **HMSL (high-mount stop light)**
- **Rear wiper motor** (Model Y)

When wires break, you'll see one or more of these symptoms:

| Symptom | Likely Broken Wire |
|---------|-------------------|
| Backup camera intermittent or black | Coaxial cable (most common) |
| One or both tail lights out | Tail light power or ground wire |
| "Trunk Open" warning when closed | Trunk latch signal wire |
| License plate lights out | License plate light circuit |
| Rear defroster stopped working | Defroster power wire |
| Brake lights not working | Brake light circuit (safety hazard!) |
| Multiple symptoms at once | Several wires broken at the flex point |

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Non-functioning brake lights are a serious safety hazard and illegal in most jurisdictions. If your brake lights are out, fix this immediately. Don't drive at night with broken tail lights.
</div>

### The Telltale Sign: Intermittent Issues

The signature of a trunk harness problem is **intermittent symptoms that change with trunk position**. Try this:

1. Open the trunk halfway and check if the backup camera works (put car in reverse)
2. Open the trunk fully and check again
3. Close the trunk and check again

If the symptoms come and go depending on trunk angle, you've found your problem. The broken wire makes contact at some positions but not others.

## Why This Happens

The wiring harness passes through a rubber grommet at the trunk hinge area. As the trunk opens and closes, the wires flex at this point. Over time:

1. **Insulation cracks** from repeated bending
2. **Copper strands break** one at a time (intermittent stage)
3. **Complete break** — the wire separates entirely
4. **Short circuits** — exposed conductors can touch each other or ground

Tesla's original 2017-2020 Model 3 harness had insufficient service loop (slack) at the flex point, causing premature failure. Tesla addressed this with **recall 21V-00D**, which installs a revised harness with more slack and a different routing.

### Is Your Car Covered by Recall?

**Recall 21V-00D** covers 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles for the coaxial cable (backup camera wire). Tesla will replace the trunk lid harness at no cost.

To check:
1. Visit [tesla.com/support](https://www.tesla.com/support) and enter your VIN
2. Or check [NHTSA.gov/recalls](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls) with your VIN
3. Or open the Tesla app → Service → check for open recalls

If your car is covered, **schedule a service appointment through the Tesla app**. This is free and Tesla Mobile Service can do it at your location.

If your car is NOT covered (Model Y, 2021+ Model 3, or out-of-recall scope), read on for the DIY fix.

## Option 1: Wire Repair (Splice and Solder)

This is the cheaper and faster option. Best when only 1-3 wires are broken and you have basic soldering skills.

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Cost:** €15-30 in materials

### What You Need

- Soldering iron (40-60W)
- Rosin-core solder (60/40 or lead-free)
- Heat-shrink tubing (various sizes, including one large enough to sleeve the entire harness section)
- Wire strippers
- Heat gun or lighter (for heat shrink)
- Multimeter (for identifying broken wires)
- Trim removal tools

### Step 1: Access the Harness

1. Open the trunk fully
2. Remove the trunk lid inner trim panel — it's held by plastic push clips. Use a trim tool to pop them out. On Model 3, there are approximately 8-10 clips. On Model Y's liftgate, the trim is larger
3. Locate the wiring harness where it passes through the rubber grommet at the hinge area
4. You'll see the harness bundle — this is the flex point where wires break

### Step 2: Identify the Broken Wires

With the trim removed, you can usually **see** the damage — cracked insulation, green corrosion on copper, or visibly separated wires.

If the damage isn't visible:

1. Set your multimeter to continuity mode
2. With the trunk open, probe each wire from the trunk-side connector to the body-side connector
3. Gently flex the harness at the grommet area while testing — a broken wire will show intermittent continuity
4. Mark each broken wire with tape

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> The coaxial cable for the backup camera is the most common failure. It's the thicker cable with a braided shield — easy to identify in the harness bundle.
</div>

### Step 3: Repair the Wires

For each broken wire:

1. **Cut the wire** on both sides of the break, removing the damaged section (usually 2-5 cm)
2. **Strip** 10-15mm of insulation from each end
3. **Slide heat-shrink tubing** onto one end before soldering (you can't add it after)
4. **Twist the strands** together with a good mechanical connection
5. **Solder the joint** — apply heat to the wire, not the solder. Let the solder flow into the connection
6. **Slide the heat-shrink** over the joint and shrink it with a heat gun

**For the coaxial cable (backup camera):**

The coaxial cable requires more care:
1. Strip the outer jacket
2. Carefully unbraid or fold back the shield
3. Strip the inner insulator to expose the center conductor
4. Splice the center conductor first, then heat-shrink
5. Reconnect the shield by overlapping the braids and soldering
6. Heat-shrink the entire repair

### Step 4: Add Service Loop

This is critical — if you just splice and put it back, the repair will fail at the same spot.

1. **Pull extra wire** from either the trunk lid side or the body side to create 3-5 cm of additional slack at the flex point
2. **Secure the harness** so the repaired section sits away from the maximum flex zone
3. The goal: when the trunk opens and closes, the repaired section shouldn't be the part that bends

### Step 5: Reassemble and Test

1. Route the harness back through the grommet
2. Ensure the grommet seats properly (it seals against water intrusion)
3. Test every trunk function:
   - Backup camera (put car in Reverse)
   - Tail lights (have someone check while you press the brake)
   - Turn signals
   - License plate lights (turn on headlights)
   - Trunk latch (close and check for warnings)
   - Rear defroster (Model 3)
4. Open and close the trunk 10-15 times while testing — make sure nothing is intermittent
5. Reinstall the trunk trim panel

## Option 2: Full Harness Replacement

If multiple wires are damaged, or you want a more permanent fix, replacing the entire trunk lid harness is the way to go.

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Cost:** €100-200 for the harness

### Ordering the Harness

- **Tesla parts:** Order through the Tesla app (Service → Order Parts) or a Tesla service center. You'll need your VIN to get the correct harness for your model year
- **Third-party:** Sites like [RR Car Parts](https://rrcarparts.com) stock Tesla trunk harnesses
- **Salvage:** Used harnesses from wrecked Teslas work fine — just inspect the flex area before buying

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Part Numbers:</strong> Tesla has revised the trunk harness multiple times. Later revisions have more service loop and better wire routing. When ordering, ask for the latest revision number for your model. The revised harness from the recall (if applicable to your year) is the one you want.
</div>

### Replacement Procedure

1. **Disconnect the 12V battery** (or 16V on newer models) under the hood — you'll be working with electrical connectors
2. **Remove the trunk lid inner trim** (push clips)
3. **Photograph everything** before disconnecting — connector positions, routing clips, grommet orientation
4. **Disconnect the harness connectors** inside the trunk lid — there are typically 2 main connectors plus individual component plugs (tail lights, latch, camera)
5. **Release the grommet** from the body — use a plastic trim tool to push it through
6. **Disconnect the body-side connectors** — these are behind the trunk opening trim. You may need to remove the package tray trim to access them
7. **Route the new harness** following the same path as the original. Use your photos as reference
8. **Seat the grommet properly** — this is your water seal. Make sure it clicks into place in the body opening
9. **Connect all plugs** — body side first, then trunk lid components
10. **Reconnect the 12V/16V battery**

### Post-Installation Testing

Test systematically:

- [ ] Backup camera works in Reverse
- [ ] Both tail lights illuminate
- [ ] Both brake lights work (press pedal, have someone verify)
- [ ] Turn signals work (both sides)
- [ ] License plate lights on with headlights
- [ ] Trunk latch closes and locks
- [ ] No "Trunk Open" warning on touchscreen
- [ ] Rear defroster works (Model 3)
- [ ] Rear wiper works (Model Y)
- [ ] HMSL (high-mount brake light) works
- [ ] Open/close trunk 10+ times — all functions remain stable

## Prevention

You can't completely prevent wire fatigue, but you can extend harness life:

1. **Don't slam the trunk** — close it gently. The power liftgate (Model Y) helps with this
2. **Inspect annually** — pull back the trunk trim and visually check the flex area for cracked insulation
3. **Keep the grommet seated** — if it pops out, water gets in and accelerates corrosion
4. **Add wire loom** — a section of split wire loom or spiral wrap around the flex area distributes bending force across a longer section

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Parts Cost | Time | Skill Level |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| Tesla recall (if eligible) | Free | 1-2 hours (service appt) | N/A |
| DIY wire splice | €15-30 | 1-2 hours | Basic soldering |
| DIY harness replacement | €100-200 | 2-3 hours | Intermediate |
| Tesla service (no recall) | €400-800 | Same day | N/A |
| Independent shop | €200-400 | Same day | N/A |

## When to See a Professional

Some scenarios are better handled by a shop:

- **You've never soldered before** — a bad solder joint on the coax cable can cause more problems
- **The body-side connectors are damaged** — requires harness work inside the car's C-pillar
- **Water damage** — if the grommet was out and water corroded the body-side wiring, the damage extends beyond the trunk lid
- **Airbag wiring concerns** — on some Model Y configurations, wiring near the C-pillar area includes side curtain airbag circuits. Don't disturb those

## Troubleshooting After Repair

**Backup camera still not working after wire repair:**
- The coax cable is particularly sensitive to poor splices. The impedance of the cable matters for the video signal. If your splice is messy, consider replacing the entire coax run
- Try a soft reboot (hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds)
- Check if the camera works intermittently or is completely dead. Completely dead after a "good" repair suggests the camera unit itself has failed

**Tail lights work but are dim:**
- Check your solder joint — a high-resistance connection reduces current flow
- Verify the ground wire is intact (often a brown or black wire)

**"Trunk Open" warning persists:**
- The latch signal wire may have an additional break point inside the trunk lid. Trace it from the latch to the harness
- Clean the latch micro switch with electrical contact cleaner (see our [trunk latch guide](/posts/tesla-trunk-latch-replacement/))
