Your Tesla won't start. The screen is black, the doors won't unlock, or the car refuses to shift into Drive. Before you panic and call a tow truck, work through this guide — most "won't start" situations have a simple fix you can do yourself.

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Key Difference from ICE Cars:</strong> Teslas don't "start" like gas cars — there's no ignition or starter motor. You sit down, press the brake, and shift into Drive. When people say their Tesla "won't start," they usually mean the car won't wake up, won't respond to the key, or won't shift into gear.
</div>

## Quick Diagnosis: What's Happening?

Before diving in, identify your specific symptom:

| Symptom | Most Likely Cause | Jump to |

| Everything works but "Car Needs Service" | Software error | [Fix #6](#fix-6-service-required-alerts) |
| Car died while driving | Emergency procedure | [Fix #7](#fix-7-car-lost-power-while-driving) |

## Fix #1: Dead 12V Battery (Most Common)

**The #1 reason a Tesla "won't start" is a dead 12V battery.** Yes, your Tesla has a small 12V battery in addition to the big high-voltage pack. It powers the computers, door latches, and everything needed to wake the car up.

### Symptoms of a Dead 12V Battery
- Completely black screen
- Doors won't unlock (key card, phone key, or fob don't work)
- No lights, no response whatsoever
- Frunk/trunk won't open
- You may have seen a "12V Battery Low — Schedule Service" warning before it died

### How to Jump-Start a Tesla

You need a portable jump starter or another 12V source. **Do NOT use another car's running engine** to jump a Tesla — voltage spikes can damage electronics.

**Model 3/Y (2021+):**

1. Pry off the **tow hook cover** on the front bumper (small panel, lower right)
2. Behind it you'll find two **jump-start terminals** (positive and negative posts)
3. Connect the **positive (+) red** cable to the positive terminal
4. Connect the **negative (−) black** cable to the negative terminal
5. Wait **30 seconds** for the car's systems to power up
6. The frunk should automatically unlatch — if not, use the manual release cable (see your owner's manual)

**Model S/X:**

1. The 12V battery is accessible under the **frunk**
2. If the frunk won't open, use the manual release (two pull cables behind the front bumper nose cone)
3. Connect your jump starter directly to the 12V battery terminals
4. Wait for systems to wake up

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Once the car wakes up, the high-voltage battery will begin charging the 12V battery. If the 12V battery is completely dead and won't hold a charge, you'll need to <a href="/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/">replace it</a>. Don't just jump it and ignore the problem — the car will die again.
</div>

### When to Replace the 12V Battery

- **Model 3/Y pre-2021:** Lead-acid battery, typical lifespan 3–5 years
- **Model 3/Y 2021+:** Lithium (LFP) battery, longer life but still can fail
- **Model S/X:** Varies by year; check for swelling or corrosion

If your 12V battery has died more than once, replace it. See our full [Tesla 12V Battery Replacement Guide](/tesla-12v-battery-replacement/).

## Fix #2: Key Not Detected

The car powers on (screen works) but displays **"Key Not Detected"** when you press the brake to shift into Drive.

### Phone Key Issues

1. **Check Bluetooth** — Toggle Bluetooth off and on in your phone settings
2. **Close and reopen the Tesla app** — Force-close it, wait 5 seconds, reopen
3. **Check phone battery** — Low battery can weaken Bluetooth signal
4. **Remove and re-add Phone Key** — In vehicle: Controls > Locks > Phone Keys, delete your phone, then re-pair it from the app
5. **Move your phone closer** — Place it on the wireless charging pad or center console. The NFC reader is in the center console area

### Key Card Backup

Always keep a key card in your wallet. If phone key fails:

1. Hold the key card against the **B-pillar** (between the front and rear doors, below the camera)
2. While holding it there, press the brake pedal
3. Shift into Drive within **2 minutes** of tapping the card

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Tip:</strong> On Model 3/Y, the card reader location is on the center console below the screen, and on the B-pillar. Try both spots if one doesn't register.
</div>

### Key Fob Issues (Model S/X)

- Replace the **CR2032 battery** in the fob ([key fob battery guide](/tesla-key-fob-battery/))
- Try holding the fob against the driver's side B-pillar
- Check if the fob is physically damaged

## Fix #3: Car Won't Shift into Drive

The screen is on, key is detected, but pressing the brake and trying to shift into Drive does nothing.

### Try These Steps

1. **Press the brake firmly** — A light press won't register. Push hard.
2. **Scroll-wheel reboot** — Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds until the screen goes black. Wait 30 seconds for it to restart. Then try again.
3. **Full power-off** — Go to Controls > Safety > Power Off. Wait 5 minutes without touching anything (doors closed, don't use app). Then press the brake to wake the car.
4. **Check for error messages** — Any red or yellow alerts on the screen? Note them.
5. **Check the brake light switch** — If your brake lights don't illuminate when you press the pedal (have someone check), the brake switch may be faulty. This prevents the car from knowing you're pressing the brake.

### Stalk vs Screen Shifting

- **Pre-2024 Model 3, all Model S/X:** Use the **stalk** on the right side of the steering column
- **2024+ Model 3 Highland, Cybertruck:** Shift via the **touchscreen** (swipe up for Drive, down for Reverse) or use the steering wheel buttons

If you recently had a software update, the shift interface may have changed. Check both methods.

## Fix #4: Doors Won't Unlock or Open

If you can't even get into the car:

### From Outside

1. **Key card on B-pillar** — Hold your key card against the B-pillar to unlock
2. **Tesla app** — Try unlocking from the app (requires internet connection to the car)
3. **Manual door release (Model 3/Y)** — There's no exterior manual release on Model 3/Y. You need to jump the 12V (see Fix #1) or call Tesla Roadside Assistance.
4. **Manual door release (Model S/X)** — Some Model S/X have a manual cable behind a small cover near the door handle

### From Inside (If Trapped)

All Teslas have **mechanical interior door releases**:

- **Model 3/Y:** Pull the manual release lever on each door (not the electronic button — the physical latch behind it). See our [Emergency Door Release Guide](/tesla-emergency-door-release/).
- **Model S/X front doors:** Manual latch near the speaker grille
- **Model X rear/falcon wing:** Manual latch in the door pocket area

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>⚠️ Never panic in a Tesla.</strong> You can ALWAYS get out from the inside using the manual releases, even with zero power. Know where they are before you need them.
</div>

## Fix #5: High-Voltage Battery Issue

The car wakes up, the screen works, but you get warnings about the **high-voltage battery** or the car has no power for driving.

### Symptoms
- "Unable to Drive" or "Power Reduced" alert
- Car won't move despite being in Drive
- Rapid range drop or 0 miles showing
- **BMS_a066** or similar battery fault codes

### What to Check

1. **Check charge level** — Is the battery actually at 0%? If so, you need to charge. Tesla Roadside can bring a mobile charger.
2. **Temperature** — In extreme cold (below −20°C / −4°F), the battery may need to precondition. Plug in and turn on Climate to warm the pack.
3. **Reboot the car** — Some HV battery faults are software glitches. Do a full power-off (Controls > Safety > Power Off), wait 5 minutes, and restart.
4. **Check for recent charging issues** — If the car threw errors during last charge, the BMS (Battery Management System) may need to recalibrate. Charge to 100% once, then drive down to 20%.

<div class="info-box">
<strong>When to Call Tesla:</strong> If you see "High Voltage System Fault — Contact Tesla Service" with a red alert, do not attempt to drive. This could indicate a serious battery or contactor issue. Schedule mobile service or a tow to a service center.
</div>

## Fix #6: Service Required Alerts

The car drives but shows persistent warning messages.

### Common Alerts and Meanings

| Alert | Meaning | Urgency |
|-------|---------|---------|
| "Schedule Service Soon" | General maintenance reminder | Low |
| "12V Battery Low" | 12V battery failing | Medium — replace soon |
| "Airbag Fault" | Airbag system error | High — get checked |
| "Power Reduced" | Thermal or battery limitation | Medium |
| "Autopilot Unavailable" | Camera/sensor issue | Low (car still drives fine) |
| "Vehicle May Not Restart" | Critical 12V or HV issue | **High — do not ignore** |

### The "Vehicle May Not Restart" Warning

This is the most critical one. If you see this:

1. **Do not turn the car off** if you can avoid it
2. Drive directly to a charger or home
3. Plug in immediately
4. Schedule Tesla Service

This usually means the 12V battery is so low that the car may not have enough power to wake up next time.

## Fix #7: Car Lost Power While Driving

If your Tesla loses power or shuts down while driving:

1. **Stay calm** — Steering and brakes still work (manual effort, no power assist)
2. **Steer to the shoulder** safely
3. **Apply the brakes** — They'll feel heavier without power assist but they work
4. **Turn on hazard lights** (if electrical system is still partially working)
5. **Put the car in Park** (if possible)
6. **Call Tesla Roadside Assistance:** Use the app or call the number in your owner's manual

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety First:</strong> A Tesla that dies while driving is rare but serious. Do not attempt to restart and drive again. Have it towed to Tesla Service for diagnosis. This could be a high-voltage contactor, fuse, or BMS failure.
</div>

## Fix #8: Software Glitch After Update

Sometimes a Tesla won't wake up properly after a software update.

### What to Do

1. **Wait 30 minutes** — Updates can continue installing after the screen appears done
2. **Scroll-wheel reboot** — Hold both scroll wheels for 10+ seconds
3. **Full power-off** — Controls > Safety > Power Off, wait 5 minutes
4. **If still stuck**, try a "3-button reset" (Model S/X): Hold both scroll wheels + brake pedal for 10 seconds
5. **Last resort:** Disconnect and reconnect the 12V battery (or jump it). This forces a full hardware reset.

## Prevention: Stop "Won't Start" Before It Happens

- **Don't let the car sit for weeks** without plugging in — the 12V battery drains slowly even when the car is "off"
- **Keep a key card** in your wallet at all times
- **Act on "12V Battery Low" warnings** immediately — don't wait for it to die
- **Keep the car plugged in** when parked at home (Tesla recommends this)
- **Maintain 20–80% charge** for daily use; charge to 100% only for trips
- **Update software** when prompted — updates often fix bugs that cause wake issues

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're storing a Tesla for more than 2 weeks, plug it in and set the charge limit to 50%. The car's systems will keep the 12V battery topped up. Without a plug, the 12V can drain in 2–4 weeks.
</div>

## When to Call Tesla Service

Handle it yourself:
- 12V battery jump/replacement
- Key/phone pairing issues
- Software reboots
- Basic troubleshooting above

Call Tesla:
- "High Voltage System Fault" red alerts
- Car lost power while driving
- Physical damage to charge port or battery
- Any issue that persists after all reboot methods

**Tesla Roadside Assistance:** Available 24/7 through the Tesla app or by phone. They can remote-diagnose many issues before sending help.

## Summary

| Issue | First Try | If That Fails |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Completely dead | Jump 12V battery | Replace 12V battery |
| Key not detected | Restart Bluetooth, use key card | Re-pair phone key |
| Won't shift to Drive | Scroll-wheel reboot | Full power-off (5 min) |
| Doors won't open | Key card on B-pillar | Jump 12V from tow hook cover |
| No driving power | Check charge, reboot | Contact Tesla Service |
| Post-update issue | Wait 30 min, then reboot | 12V disconnect/reconnect |

Most "Tesla won't start" situations are solved by either **jumping/replacing the 12V battery** or **rebooting the car**. Keep a portable jump starter in your garage and a key card in your wallet, and you'll handle 90% of these situations in under 10 minutes.
