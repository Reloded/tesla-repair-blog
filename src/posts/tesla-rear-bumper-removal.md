![Tesla Model Y complete teardown with body panels removed in workshop](/images/repairs/model-y-full-teardown.jpg)

Removing the rear bumper on a Tesla Model 3 or Model Y is one of those jobs that looks intimidating but is actually very manageable with basic tools and some patience. Whether you need access for a [tow hitch installation](/tesla-tow-hitch-install/), [paint chip repair](/tesla-paint-chip-repair/), [PPF installation](/tesla-ppf-installation/), parking sensor replacement, or [tail light work](/tesla-tail-light-replacement/), this guide walks you through every step — verified against Tesla's official service manual on service.tesla.com.

If you've already tackled the [front bumper removal](/tesla-front-bumper-removal/), you'll find the rear is actually simpler. Fewer clips, fewer connectors, and the fascia is lighter. Most people can do this in 30–45 minutes the first time.

## Why You Might Need to Remove the Rear Bumper

- **Paint repair or respray** — Scratches, dents, or collision damage on the rear fascia
- **PPF (paint protection film) installation** — Wrapping edges properly requires bumper removal for a clean finish
- **Tow hitch installation** — Both the Tesla OEM hitch and aftermarket options require rear bumper removal
- **Parking sensor replacement** — Ultrasonic sensors are mounted in the bumper fascia (pre-HW4 vehicles)
- **Tail light access** — While tail lights can be removed with the bumper on, having it off makes the job much easier
- **Vinyl wrap** — Getting wrap material around edges and into gaps
- **Rear diffuser replacement** — The diffuser/lower fascia attaches directly to the upper bumper fascia
- **[Water leak investigation](/tesla-water-leak-fix/)** — Checking tail light seals and trunk seam sealer

## Difficulty Rating

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium (3/5) |
| **Time Required** | 30–45 minutes (first time), 20 minutes (experienced) |
| **People Needed** | 1 person possible, 2 recommended for removal/installation |
| **Risk Level** | Low — no high-voltage components, no airbag systems |
| **Tesla Service FRT** | 0.54 hrs (Model 3), 0.66 hrs (Model Y) |

## Model 3 vs. Model Y: Key Differences

Before you start, know what's different between the two models:

| Feature | Model 3 (2017–2023) | Model Y (2020–2024) |
|---|---|---|
| **Wheel well clips** | 3 per side | 4 per side |
| **Quarter panel bolt** | T25 Torx (inner) | 8mm hex (side) |
| **Diffuser bolts** | 5× bolts (10mm) per side | 7× bolts + 6× clips |
| **Mid aero shield** | 5× bolts (10mm) to remove | Not applicable |
| **Fender garnish** | Not required | Must remove LH & RH rear fender garnish |
| **U-nut** | Yes — behind fascia on quarter panel | No |
| **Electrical harness** | Yes (all years) | HW3 only — skip on HW4 vehicles |
| **Sensor connector** | 1 connector (RH side) | 1 connector (HW3 only) |

### What About the 2024+ Model 3 (Highland)?

The 2024+ Model 3 "Highland" refresh has a redesigned rear fascia with different clip and bolt locations. The procedure uses clips (×3) per side on the wheel arch liner instead of the pre-2023 layout. The general approach is similar, but the specific fastener locations differ. Tesla's service manual lists the procedure separately under "Fascia Assembly - Rear (Remove and Install)" for the 2024+ model.

## Tools Required

**Essential:**
- 10mm socket with ratchet
- 8mm socket or stubby wrench
- T25 Torx bit socket (Model 3) or 8mm hex with 4" extension (Model Y)
- 2-inch socket extension bar
- Trim removal / clip pry tool set
- Painter's tape (blue or green)

**Recommended:**
- Floor jack + [Tesla jack pads](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tesla+jack+pads&tag=diyrepair07-20) (or ramps)
- Jack stands
- Magnetic parts tray
- Gloves
- A helper for the final removal step

**Torque wrench** (for reinstallation):
- All rear fascia bolts torque to **4 Nm (2.9 lb-ft)** — very light!
- Mid aero shield bolts (Model 3): **5 Nm (3.7 lb-ft)**
- Quarter panel Torx bolt (Model 3): **2 Nm (1.5 lb-ft)**

## Step-by-Step: Tesla Rear Bumper Removal

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Park on a flat, level surface and engage the parking brake
2. If you have access to a jack or lift, raise the rear of the vehicle — this makes accessing the underbody bolts much easier. Use proper [Tesla jack pads](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tesla+jack+pad+model+3+Y&tag=diyrepair07-20) on the designated jack points to avoid damaging the battery pack
3. Apply two layers of painter's tape along both rear quarter panels where the bumper meets the body. This prevents scratches when sliding the bumper off

> **💡 Tip:** You can do this job without raising the vehicle — you'll just be spending more time on your back reaching underneath. A creeper or cardboard helps.

### Step 2: Remove Both Tail Lights

The tail lights must come out first on both models. This is the same procedure as our [tail light replacement guide](/tesla-tail-light-replacement/).

1. Open the trunk/liftgate
2. Pop off the trim bolt cover on top of each tail light and remove the bolt
3. Peel back the rubber weather seal around each tail light
4. **Model 3:** Pull back the trunk liner fabric behind each tail light area to access the electrical connector. Push the red clip up, then wiggle the connector free
5. **Model Y:** Remove the trunk side trim panel clips (4 clips) and move the panel aside. Pop out the side trim pieces enough to access the 8mm bolts
6. Use a stubby 8mm wrench to remove the two 8mm bolts holding each tail light
7. Pull each tail light **straight out** — don't angle it, or you risk breaking the alignment guide rails

> **⚠️ Warning:** The tail light guide rails are fragile plastic. Always pull straight back, never side to side. Replacements are expensive.

### Step 3: Remove Quarter Panel Fasteners

This step differs between Model 3 and Model Y:

**Model 3 (2017–2023):**
1. Remove the **10mm bolt** that attaches the corner of the rear fascia to the outer quarter panel (one per side)
2. Use a clip pry tool to release the **3 clips and push nut** that attach the rear wheel arch liner to the body (each side)
3. Remove the **T25 Torx screw** that attaches the fascia to the inner quarter panel (each side, use a 2" extension)
4. **Important:** Without pulling back the fascia, reach behind it and remove the **U-nut** that attaches the fascia to the quarter panel. If you pull the fascia back with the U-nut still installed, it will scratch the quarter panel paint

**Model Y (2020–2024):**
1. Remove the **10mm bolt** that attaches the corner of the rear fascia to the body (one per side)
2. Remove the LH rear **fender garnish** — this is a trim piece that pries off with a trim tool
3. Remove the **8mm bolt** (with 4" extension) that attaches the side of the rear fascia to the body (one per side)
4. Use a clip pry tool to release the **4 clips** on each wheel arch liner
5. Repeat garnish and bolt removal on the RH side

### Step 4: Remove Underbody Bolts

Get under the vehicle (or use your lift/jack) for this step.

**Model 3 (2017–2023):**
1. Remove the **5× 10mm bolts** that attach the rear portion of the mid aero shield panel to the rear subframe
2. Remove the **5× 10mm bolts** that attach the rear diffuser to the body (each side — 10 total)

> **💡 Tip:** Use a 2-inch extension to make reaching these bolts easier. A magnetic parts tray keeps track of all the hardware.

**Model Y (2020–2024):**
1. Remove the **7× 10mm bolts** and **6× clips** that attach the rear fascia to the rear diffuser

### Step 5: Disconnect the Electrical Harness

**Model 3 (all years):** Disconnect the rear fascia electrical harness. The connector is located on the right (passenger) side, behind the bumper. Slide the red locking tab out, then press the black release tab to disconnect.

**Model Y:**
- **HW3 vehicles (pre-2023):** Disconnect the rear fascia electrical harness — same connector type as Model 3
- **HW4 vehicles (2023+):** **Skip this step entirely.** HW4 vehicles do not have a rear fascia electrical harness connector (ultrasonic parking sensors were removed)

> **💡 How to tell HW3 vs HW4:** If your car has circular ultrasonic parking sensors visible in the bumper, it's HW3. If the bumper is smooth with no sensor holes, it's HW4.

### Step 6: Remove the Rear Bumper

1. Starting from one side, gently pull the bumper away from the body to release the alignment clips. Alternate between sides
2. Work your way toward the center, gradually releasing all clips
3. Once the sides are free, carefully pull the center section while supporting the bumper with your knee or having your helper hold it
4. Lift the bumper away from the vehicle

> **⚠️ Caution:** Be careful not to let the bumper's corner fastener clips scratch the quarter panels as you slide it off. This is why you applied painter's tape in Step 1.

> **💡 Pro tip:** If doing this solo, place a moving blanket or cardboard on the ground behind the car to set the bumper on. The bumper is lightweight but awkward to handle alone.

## Rear Bumper Fastener Map

Here's a summary of every fastener you'll remove:

### Model 3 (2017–2023)
| Location | Fastener | Quantity | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top (tail light area) | 10mm bolt | 2 (1 per side) | 10mm hex |
| Inner quarter panel | T25 Torx screw | 2 (1 per side) | T25 Torx + 2" extension |
| Quarter panel | U-nut | 2 (1 per side) | By hand |
| Wheel arch liner | Push clips | 6 (3 per side) | Clip pry tool |
| Wheel arch liner | Push nut | 2 (1 per side) | Clip pry tool |
| Mid aero shield | 10mm bolt | 5 | 10mm hex + 2" extension |
| Rear diffuser (per side) | 10mm bolt | 5 per side (10 total) | 10mm hex + 2" extension |
| **Total** | | **~29 fasteners** | |

### Model Y (2020–2024)
| Location | Fastener | Quantity | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top corners | 10mm bolt | 2 (1 per side) | 10mm hex |
| Side (behind garnish) | 8mm bolt | 2 (1 per side) | 8mm hex + 4" extension |
| Wheel arch liner | Push clips | 8 (4 per side) | Clip pry tool |
| Rear diffuser | 10mm bolt | 7 | 10mm socket + 2" extension |
| Rear diffuser | Clips | 6 | Clip pry tool |
| Fender garnish | Clips | — (pry off) | Trim tool |
| **Total** | | **~25 fasteners** | |

## Reinstallation Tips

Installing the rear bumper is essentially the reverse of removal, but here are some tips to make it smoother:

1. **Start from the center.** Align the center section first, then work outward to each side. On the Model Y, look for the triangle alignment mark on the body and the rectangular wedge on the bumper — these guide proper centering
2. **Reconnect the electrical harness first** (before fully seating the bumper) so you don't have to fight to reach it later
3. **Apply threadlocker** to the diffuser bolts before reinstalling — Tesla specifies this in the service manual
4. **Don't overtorque!** All fascia bolts are only 4 Nm (2.9 lb-ft). These are plastic clips and thin sheet metal — gorilla-tightening will strip threads or crack mounting tabs
5. **Model 3:** Install the U-nut and inner T25 Torx screw before pushing the fascia fully against the quarter panel
6. **Check all clips are seated.** Walk around the bumper and press firmly along all edges to ensure every alignment clip has snapped into place
7. **Model Y fender garnish:** When reinstalling the trim pieces by the wheels, install the bottom portion first and align that before snapping the top. Getting this wrong means removing and starting over

### Torque Specifications (Reinstallation)

| Fastener | Torque | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Corner fascia bolt (both models) | 4 Nm (2.9 lb-ft) | 10mm hex |
| Diffuser bolts (both models) | 4 Nm (2.9 lb-ft) | 10mm socket + 2" extension |
| Side fascia bolt — Model Y | 4 Nm (2.9 lb-ft) | 8mm hex + 4" extension |
| Inner quarter panel — Model 3 | 2 Nm (1.5 lb-ft) | T25 Torx + 2" extension |
| Mid aero shield — Model 3 | 5 Nm (3.7 lb-ft) | 10mm hex + 2" extension |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting the U-Nut (Model 3)
The U-nut behind the fascia on the quarter panel is easy to miss. If you pull the bumper back without removing it first, it will gouge into your quarter panel paint. Always reach behind the fascia and remove the U-nut before pulling the bumper away.

### 2. Breaking Tail Light Guide Rails
The plastic alignment pins on the tail lights are fragile. Pull straight out — never wiggle side to side. If you break one, the tail light won't sit flush and you'll have a water leak issue. Check our [water leak fix guide](/tesla-water-leak-fix/) if this happens.

### 3. Losing the T25 Torx Screw (Model 3)
The inner quarter panel T25 screw tends to fall into the bumper cavity when removed. Don't panic — just retrieve it after the bumper is off. Better yet, use a magnetic bit holder.

### 4. Not Taping the Quarter Panels
The quarter panel paint is soft and the bumper edges are hard plastic. Even a small scrape leaves a mark. Two layers of painter's tape takes 30 seconds and saves you from needing [paint chip repair](/tesla-paint-chip-repair/) later.

### 5. Overtorquing on Reinstall
These bolts are rated at just 4 Nm — that's barely more than hand-tight. A quarter turn past snug is usually right. Using an impact driver or over-tightening will crack the plastic mounting tabs on the bumper or strip the body panel threads.

### 6. Skipping the Harness on HW3 Vehicles
If your car has parking sensors (HW3), you must disconnect the electrical harness before fully removing the bumper or you'll yank the wiring. HW4 vehicles (no ultrasonic sensors) don't have this connector.

### 7. Not Using Threadlocker on Diffuser Bolts
Tesla specifies threadlocker on the diffuser bolts during reinstallation. These bolts are exposed to road spray, vibration, and temperature cycling. Without threadlocker, they can work loose over time and you'll hear rattling from underneath.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I remove the rear bumper without a lift or jack?**
Yes. It's more uncomfortable since you'll be on your back reaching the underbody bolts, but it's completely doable on a flat surface. Driving up on ramps helps if you have them.

**Do I need to disconnect the 12V battery?**
No. There are no airbag components or high-voltage systems in the rear bumper area. The only electrical connection is the parking sensor harness (HW3), which is a simple low-voltage connector.

**How long does it take?**
First-timers: 30–45 minutes. Once you've done it before: 15–20 minutes. The tail light removal is actually the most time-consuming part.

**Will removing the bumper void my warranty?**
Removing body panels for maintenance or aftermarket accessory installation (like a tow hitch) does not void your warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. However, if you damage something during removal, that damage wouldn't be covered.

**Can I do this alone?**
Yes, but having a second person to hold the bumper during the final removal step is very helpful. The bumper is lightweight but awkward to manage while also disconnecting the harness.

**What's different about the rear vs. [front bumper](/tesla-front-bumper-removal/)?**
The rear is actually easier. The front bumper has more clips, fog light connectors (on some trims), and requires removing the front wheel arch liners more extensively. The rear has fewer fasteners overall and the fascia is lighter.

## Wrapping Up

The Tesla rear bumper removal is a straightforward job that opens the door to many other repairs and upgrades. The key things to remember: tape your quarter panels, pull the tail lights straight out, don't forget the U-nut (Model 3), and go easy on the torque during reinstallation. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you'll have the bumper off in under an hour — and you'll save hundreds compared to having a shop do it.

If you're planning a tow hitch install, PPF wrap, or paint repair, having this skill in your toolkit pays for itself immediately. And once you've done it once, you'll realize just how simple Tesla made these cars to work on.
