If your Tesla Model S or Model X key fob stops working or shows reduced range, the battery is likely dead. This is a 2-minute fix that costs under $5. Tesla doesn't charge much for this either, but why make a trip when you can fix it at home?

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Model 3 and Model Y Owners:</strong> These models use key cards and phone keys instead of fobs. The key card has no battery—if it stops working, it may be damaged and needs replacement ($25 from Tesla).

## Symptoms of a Dying Key Fob Battery

- **Reduced range** - Need to be closer to the car to unlock
- **Inconsistent response** - Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't
- **Delayed unlock** - Takes a second or two instead of instant
- **Key fob not detected** warning on the touchscreen
- **Fob completely dead** - No response at all

## What Battery Do You Need?

Tesla key fobs use a **CR2032** coin cell battery—one of the most common battery types available.

**Where to Buy:**
- Any grocery or drug store
- Amazon (buy in bulk - they're cheap)
- Costco multi-packs

**Cost:** $3-8 for a 2-pack

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Buy a 10-pack of CR2032 batteries. They last 1-2 years in the fob, and you'll use them in other devices too. Much cheaper in bulk.

## Step-by-Step Replacement

### Model S Key Fob (All Years)

The Model S fob is shaped like a miniature car.

**Step 1:** Locate the seam around the edge of the fob

**Step 2:** Insert a small flathead screwdriver or coin into the seam

**Step 3:** Gently twist to separate the two halves of the fob

**Step 4:** The battery is visible once open—note which side is facing up (+ side)

**Step 5:** Pop out the old battery

**Step 6:** Insert the new CR2032 with the + side facing the same direction

**Step 7:** Snap the two halves back together

**Step 8:** Test by pressing a button (LEDs should light up)

### Model X Key Fob (All Years)

The Model X fob is shaped like the Model X vehicle with falcon wing "doors."

**Step 1:** Flip the fob over to see the back panel

**Step 2:** Locate the small release tab or seam

**Step 3:** Use a small flathead to gently pry open the back cover

**Step 4:** Remove the old battery—note orientation

**Step 5:** Install new CR2032 battery

**Step 6:** Snap the cover back on

**Step 7:** Test the buttons

## After Replacement

The key fob should work immediately after battery replacement. There's no re-pairing required. If it doesn't work:

1. **Check battery orientation** - Make sure + is facing the right way
2. **Try a different battery** - Occasionally you get a dud
3. **Clean the contacts** - Use a dry cloth to clean the battery contacts
4. **Re-pair the fob** - If still not working, you may need to re-pair it to the car through the touchscreen (Controls > Locks > Add Key)

## Key Fob Won't Work at All?

If a new battery doesn't solve the problem:

- **Water damage** - If the fob got wet, the circuit may be damaged
- **Physical damage** - Drops can break internal components
- **Pairing lost** - Try re-pairing through the car's settings
- **Fob failure** - Rare, but fobs do fail. Replacement is ~$175 from Tesla

## How Long Does the Battery Last?

- **Typical lifespan:** 12-24 months
- **Heavy use:** 8-12 months
- **Light use:** 2+ years

Battery life depends on how often you use the buttons and how far you are from the car when using them.

## Cost Summary

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| CR2032 Battery | $2-5 |
| Your time | 2 minutes |
| Tesla service (for comparison) | $20-30 |

*Keep a spare CR2032 in your car's center console. When the fob starts acting up, you can swap batteries anywhere in under 2 minutes.*
