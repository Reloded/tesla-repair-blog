faq:
  - q: "What size wiper blades does a Tesla Model 3 use?"
    a: "Tesla Model 3 (all years) uses a 26-inch driver side blade and a 19-inch passenger side blade. These are standard J-hook or pinch-tab style blades available from any auto parts store."
  - q: "How do I put my Tesla wipers in service position?"
    a: "Go to Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode on the touchscreen. The wipers will raise to a vertical position so you can access them. On Model S/X, you can also hold the wiper stalk down for a few seconds."
  - q: "Can I use aftermarket wiper blades on a Tesla?"
    a: "Yes. Any quality wiper blade in the correct size works. Bosch ICON, Rain-X Latitude, and PIAA Super Silicone are popular choices that fit all Tesla models. You don't need Tesla-branded blades."
  - q: "Why are my new Tesla wipers chattering?"
    a: "Chattering is usually caused by a dirty windshield, incorrect blade size, or a wiper arm that needs adjustment. Clean the windshield thoroughly with glass cleaner, verify the blade size, and check that the arm spring has enough tension."
  - q: "How often should I replace Tesla wiper blades?"
    a: "Every 6-12 months depending on climate. Hot, sunny climates dry out rubber faster. If you notice streaking, skipping, or squeaking, it's time to replace regardless of age."

**Replacing Tesla wipers is a 5-minute job — if you know about Service Mode.** Skip this step and the wipers will hit your hood when you lift them. Here's how to do it right, plus the correct blade sizes for every model and year.

> **Quick steps:** Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode → Lift wiper arm → Press release tab and slide old blade off → Slide new blade on until it clicks → Lower arm → Exit service mode. Done.

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Don't overpay:</strong> Tesla charges $50-80 for wiper blade replacement. DIY cost is $20-60 for premium blades. Same blades, same result — you just save the labor fee and the service appointment wait.
</div>

## When to Replace Your Wipers

Signs your wiper blades need replacement:

- **Streaking** — Lines of water left behind on the glass
- **Skipping** — Blade hops across the windshield instead of gliding
- **Squeaking** — Noise during operation (especially on dry or lightly wet glass)
- **Smearing** — Water pushed around instead of wiped clean
- **Chattering** — Vibration or juddering during use
- **Visible damage** — Cracked, torn, split, or hardened rubber edge

**Replacement interval:** Every 6–12 months, or when performance degrades. Hot climates wear rubber faster; cold climates cause hardening and cracking.

## Tesla Wiper Blade Sizes (All Models & Years)

| Model | Years | Driver Side | Passenger Side | Attachment Type |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Model 3 | 2017–2025 | 26" (650mm) | 19" (475mm) | Pinch tab |
| Model Y | 2020–2025 | 26" (650mm) | 19" (475mm) | Pinch tab |
| Model S | 2012–2020 | 28" (700mm) | 19" (475mm) | Pinch tab |
| Model S | 2021+ (Refresh) | 28" (700mm) | 19" (475mm) | Pinch tab |
| Model X | 2016–2025 | 28" (700mm) | 17" (425mm) | Pinch tab |

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> All Tesla models use a pinch-tab (also called "push button") attachment — not the traditional J-hook found on most cars. When buying aftermarket blades, make sure they include a pinch-tab adapter. Most premium brands (Bosch ICON, Rain-X Latitude) include multi-fit adapters in the box.

## Step-by-Step: Wiper Blade Replacement

### Step 1: Activate Wiper Service Mode

Tesla wipers park hidden under the hood cowl. You **must** raise them before attempting to lift the wiper arms, or the arms will hit the hood and potentially scratch it or crack the cowl trim.

**Model 3 and Model Y:**
1. Put the car in Park with the touchscreen on
2. Go to **Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode**
3. The wipers will automatically move to a raised, vertical position
4. You now have full access to the blades

**Model S (all years):**
1. Turn off auto-wipers first
2. Go to **Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode**
3. Alternatively: push the wiper stalk down and hold for a few seconds to move wipers to the top of their travel

**Model X:**
1. Same as Model S — **Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode**
2. The wiper arms will clear the large windshield and move to an accessible position

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> If you skip Service Mode and try to manually lift the wiper arms from their parked position, you risk bending the arms, scratching the hood, or cracking the plastic cowl cover. Always use Service Mode first.
</div>

### Step 2: Remove the Old Wiper Blade

1. **Lift the wiper arm** away from the windshield until it locks in the upright position
2. **Find the release tab** — it's a small plastic button or tab where the blade meets the arm
3. **Press the release tab** and slide the blade downward along the arm
4. The blade will detach from the hook/pinch connection
5. Set the old blade aside

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Critical:</strong> Don't let the bare wiper arm snap back against the windshield — the metal arm can crack the glass! Either hold the arm the entire time, or lay a thick folded towel on the windshield as protection.
</div>

### Step 3: Install the New Wiper Blade

1. **Align the new blade** with the wiper arm connector
2. **Slide the blade upward** onto the arm until you hear/feel a **click**
3. **Verify it's secure** by gently tugging on the blade — it shouldn't move
4. **Gently lower the arm** back toward the windshield
5. **Repeat** for the other side

### Step 4: Exit Service Mode and Test

1. Tap **Exit** on the Service Mode screen (or it exits automatically when you shift into Drive)
2. Spray washer fluid using the wiper stalk button
3. Run the wipers through several cycles at different speeds
4. Check for streaks, skipping, chattering, or unusual noises
5. If anything seems off, re-lift the arm and verify the blade clicked in completely

## Wiper Arm Replacement

In rare cases, the wiper arm itself may need replacement — not just the blade. Signs of a bad wiper arm:

- **Wiper doesn't press firmly** against the windshield (weak spring tension)
- **Arm is bent or misaligned** — blade contacts at wrong angle
- **Rust or corrosion** on the arm (especially in salt-heavy climates)
- **Wiper doesn't return** to the correct park position

### How to Replace a Wiper Arm

This is slightly more involved than blade replacement:

1. **Activate Service Mode** (same as above)
2. **Lift the wiper arm** and note its position
3. **Pop off the nut cover** at the base of the arm (small plastic cap)
4. **Remove the nut** — typically 13mm or 14mm
5. **Rock the arm gently** to release it from the splined shaft (a wiper arm puller tool helps if it's stuck)
6. **Install the new arm** — align it with the splined shaft in the correct park position
7. **Torque the nut** to spec and replace the cover cap
8. **Install a new blade** on the new arm

**Cost:** Tesla OEM wiper arms run $40–80 each. Check [RR Car Parts](https://rrcarparts.com/collections/all?q=wiper+arm) for OEM parts, or [Amazon DE](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=tesla+wiper+arm+replacement&tag=diyrepair-21) / [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tesla+wiper+arm+replacement&tag=diyrepair07-20) for aftermarket options.

## Common Wiper Problems & Fixes

### Streaking After Replacement

**Cause:** Dirty windshield, protective coating still on new blades, or blade not seated properly.

**Fix:**
1. Clean the windshield thoroughly with glass cleaner (not household glass cleaner — use automotive)
2. Wipe the rubber edge of the new blade with rubbing alcohol to remove any factory coating
3. Verify blade is clicked in securely

### Chattering / Vibration

**Cause:** Wiper arm tension too low, blade wrong size, dirty windshield, or windshield needs treatment.

**Fix:**
1. Clean the windshield with a clay bar + glass cleaner to remove contaminants
2. Apply a glass treatment (Rain-X or similar) for smoother operation
3. Verify correct blade size for your model
4. If chattering persists, the wiper arm spring may be weak — consider arm replacement

### Wipers Not Parking Correctly

**Cause:** After blade replacement, wipers sometimes park too high or in the wrong position.

**Fix:**
1. Exit and re-enter Service Mode
2. If still wrong, do a soft reset (hold both steering wheel buttons for 10 seconds)
3. Check that the wiper arm nut is tight — a loose arm can slip on the splined shaft

### Squeaking on Dry Glass

**Cause:** This is normal — wiper blades are designed to work on wet glass. Dry wiping causes friction noise.

**Fix:**
1. Always spray washer fluid before using wipers
2. Apply a hydrophobic coating (Rain-X, Gtechniq G1) to the windshield — water beads off and you'll use wipers less
3. Check your auto-wiper sensitivity setting — lower it if wipers activate in light mist

### Auto-Wipers Activating Randomly

**Cause:** Tesla's camera-based auto-wiper system can be overly sensitive. This isn't a blade issue.

**Fix:**
1. Adjust auto-wiper sensitivity on the touchscreen wiper menu
2. Clean the windshield area in front of the cabin camera (top center of windshield)
3. Software updates continually improve auto-wiper behavior

## Maintaining Your Wipers

Extend wiper blade life with these habits:

1. **Clean the blades monthly** — Wipe the rubber edge with a damp cloth or rubbing alcohol
2. **Keep your windshield clean** — Dirt, bugs, and tree sap accelerate blade wear
3. **Lift blades in winter** — Prevents them from freezing to the glass (see our [winter preparation guide](/posts/tesla-winter-preparation-guide/))
4. **Avoid dry wiping** — Always use washer fluid first
5. **Use quality washer fluid** — Not plain water; it doesn't clean and leaves mineral deposits
6. **Apply windshield coating** — [Ceramic coating](/posts/tesla-ceramic-coating/) or Rain-X reduces wiper usage

## Washer Fluid Refill

While you're maintaining wipers, top off your washer fluid:

**Reservoir Location:** Under the frunk (front trunk) on all Tesla models. Pop the frunk, find the blue cap.

**What to use:**
- Standard blue washer fluid — works fine for most climates
- Rain-X washer fluid — adds water-beading properties
- Winter: Use fluid rated to **-20°C or -40°C** to prevent freezing

**Capacity:**
- Model 3/Y: ~3.5 liters (0.9 gallons)
- Model S/X: ~5 liters (1.3 gallons)

## Cost Comparison: DIY vs Tesla Service

| Option | Cost (Both Blades) | Time |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Tesla Service Center | $50–80 + wait | 1–2 weeks for appointment |
| DIY with Premium Blades (Bosch ICON) | $50–60 | 5 minutes |
| DIY with Mid-Range (Rain-X Latitude) | $35–45 | 5 minutes |
| DIY with Budget Blades | $16–30 | 5 minutes |

The cost savings on wipers are modest, but the real win is **not waiting for a service appointment** to do a 5-minute job. Plus, you pick exactly which blades you want instead of whatever Tesla stocks.

*Good visibility is a safety issue — don't wait until you can barely see through the rain. Check your wipers at every [tire rotation](/posts/tesla-tire-rotation/) and replace at the first sign of streaking.*
