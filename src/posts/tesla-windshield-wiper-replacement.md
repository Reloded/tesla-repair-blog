Windshield wipers are a wear item that most people ignore until they can barely see in the rain. Replacing wipers on a Tesla is identical to any other car—except you need to put the car in "Service Mode" to access them properly.

## When to Replace Your Wipers

Signs your wiper blades need replacement:

- **Streaking** - Lines left behind on the glass
- **Skipping** - Blade hops across the windshield
- **Squeaking** - Noise during operation
- **Smearing** - Water pushed around instead of cleared
- **Visible damage** - Cracked, torn, or hardened rubber
- **Chattering** - Vibration during use

**Replacement interval:** Every 6-12 months, or when performance degrades.

## Tesla Wiper Blade Sizes

| Model | Driver Side | Passenger Side |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Model 3 | 26" | 19" |
| Model Y | 26" | 19" |
| Model S | 28" | 19" |
| Model X | 28" | 17" |

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Always verify sizes for your specific year. Some model years have variations.
</div>

   - Great in all weather

2. **Rain-X Latitude** (~$18-22 each)

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't cheap out on wiper blades. The difference between a $10 blade and a $25 blade is significant in performance and longevity.

## Step-by-Step Replacement

### Step 1: Activate Service Mode

Tesla wipers park in a position where they're hidden by the hood. You need to raise them for access:

**Model 3 and Model Y:**
1. With the car on (not in drive), go to **Controls > Service > Wiper Service Mode**
2. The wipers will move to a vertical position

**Model S and Model X:**
1. Turn off auto-wipers
2. Use the wiper stalk to move wipers to the highest position
3. Or access through Controls > Service

### Step 2: Remove the Old Wiper Blade

1. Lift the wiper arm away from the windshield
2. Locate the release tab or button on the wiper blade
3. Press the tab and slide the blade down/off the arm
4. The blade will slide out of the hook

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Don't let the bare wiper arm snap back against the windshield—it can crack the glass! Lay a towel on the windshield as protection, or hold the arm the entire time.
</div>

### Step 3: Install the New Wiper Blade

1. Slide the new blade onto the wiper arm hook
2. Push until it clicks into place
3. Verify it's secure by gently tugging on it
4. Gently lower the arm back to the windshield
5. Repeat for the other side

### Step 4: Test the Wipers

1. Exit service mode (it should exit automatically when you drive)
2. Spray washer fluid
3. Run the wipers through several cycles
4. Check for streaks, skipping, or unusual noises

## Maintaining Your Wipers

To extend wiper life:

1. **Clean the blades monthly** - Wipe the rubber edge with a damp cloth
2. **Clean your windshield** - Dirt and bugs accelerate wear
3. **Lift blades in winter** - Prevents them from freezing to the glass
4. **Avoid dry wiping** - Always use washer fluid
5. **Replace washer fluid** - Use quality fluid, not just water

## Washer Fluid Refill

While you're maintaining wipers, check your washer fluid:

**Location:** Under the frunk (front trunk) on all Tesla models

**What to use:**
- Standard blue washer fluid works fine
- Rain-X washer fluid adds water-beading properties
- In winter: Use -20°F or -40°F rated fluid to prevent freezing

**Capacity:** ~3.5 gallons (Model 3/Y), ~5 gallons (Model S/X)

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost (Both Blades) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Tesla Service | $50-80 |
| DIY Premium (Bosch ICON) | $50-60 |
| DIY Mid-range (Rain-X) | $35-45 |
| DIY Budget | $20-30 |

For this repair, the savings aren't huge, but it's so easy there's no reason to pay for service.

*Good visibility is a safety issue. Don't wait until you can barely see through the rain to replace your wipers. Check them at every tire rotation.*
