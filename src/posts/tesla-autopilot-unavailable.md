Seeing "Autopilot Unavailable" or "Cruise Control Unavailable" on your Tesla's screen is frustrating, especially when you rely on these features for highway driving. The good news is that most causes are temporary and can be resolved without a service visit.

## Why Autopilot Becomes Unavailable

Tesla's Autopilot system requires all cameras and sensors to function properly. When any component is compromised, the system disables itself for safety.

### Common Causes

1. **Camera calibration needed** - After windshield replacement or service
2. **Weather conditions** - Rain, fog, snow blocking cameras
3. **Dirty cameras** - Accumulated road grime
4. **Software glitches** - Temporary system errors
5. **Hardware problems** - Camera or sensor failure

## Quick Fixes to Try First

### 1. Clean Your Cameras

Tesla vehicles have 8 cameras that Autopilot relies on:

- **Front-facing** (3) - Behind windshield
- **Side cameras** (4) - In fenders and B-pillars
- **Rear camera** (1) - Above license plate

**Cleaning tips:**
- Use a soft microfiber cloth
- Spray glass cleaner on the cloth, not the camera
- Gently wipe each camera lens
- Check for water spots or film
- Don't forget the cameras in the fenders

### 2. Perform a System Reboot

A soft reboot often clears temporary glitches:

1. Park your Tesla safely
2. Hold both scroll wheels for 10 seconds
3. Release when the screen goes dark
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for reboot
5. Autopilot may recalibrate automatically

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A power cycle (leaving the car off for 10+ minutes) can resolve persistent issues that a soft reboot doesn't fix.

### 3. Check Weather Conditions

Autopilot disables in certain conditions:

- **Heavy rain** - Water on cameras
- **Snow/ice** - Blocked sensors
- **Dense fog** - Limited visibility
- **Direct sunlight** - Camera glare
- **Extreme darkness** - Insufficient lighting

Wait for conditions to improve, then try again.

## Camera Calibration

If you see "Cameras Calibrating" after a windshield replacement or service:

### What to Expect

- Calibration requires **20-100 miles** of driving
- Drive on **well-marked roads** with clear lane lines
- Highways work better than city streets
- Process can take **several hours**
- Each camera calibrates independently

### Force Recalibration

If calibration seems stuck, see our full [camera calibration guide](/posts/tesla-autopilot-camera-calibration/):

1. Go to **Controls > Service > Camera Calibration**
2. Select **Clear Calibration**
3. Drive on a highway with clear markings
4. Monitor progress on the screen

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Clearing calibration will make Autopilot unavailable until all cameras recalibrate. Only do this if calibration appears stuck.
</div>

## Checking Camera Status

To see which cameras are working:

1. Open **Controls > Service**
2. Review camera status indicators
3. Offline cameras will show a warning
4. Individual camera issues may need service

## Software-Related Issues

### After an Update

Sometimes Autopilot issues appear after software updates:

1. Check for **new update** that might fix the issue
2. Review **release notes** for known issues
3. A **full power cycle** can help post-update
4. Allow **24-48 hours** for systems to stabilize

### Bug Reports

Help Tesla improve by sending a bug report:

1. Say **"Bug report"** followed by issue description
2. Or press the voice command button and report
3. Tesla reviews reports to identify patterns

## When to Schedule Service

Contact Tesla Service if:

- Cameras remain unavailable after cleaning and reboots
- Calibration doesn't progress after 200+ miles
- You see **hardware error** messages
- Autopilot worked, then suddenly stopped
- Multiple cameras show offline simultaneously

### Service Appointment Tips

- Note when the issue started
- Document any recent changes (windshield, service)
- Take screenshots of error messages
- Record which cameras show problems

## Prevention Tips

Keep Autopilot working reliably:

- **Clean cameras weekly** during dirty weather
- **Update software** promptly when available
- **Protect windshield** - chips can affect cameras
- **Park in shade** when possible to reduce sun damage

*Most Autopilot unavailability issues are temporary. Try the simple fixes first before scheduling service - you'll often save yourself a trip.*
