One of the great things about owning a Tesla is that brake pads last significantly longer than on gas cars—thanks to regenerative braking. However, they do eventually wear out, and when they do, you can save hundreds by replacing them yourself.

## Why Tesla Brakes Last Longer

Teslas use regenerative braking, which means the electric motors slow the car down and recapture energy. The traditional friction brakes are used much less frequently, typically only for:

- Hard stops
- Low-speed maneuvering
- Emergency braking
- When [regen is limited](/posts/tesla-regen-braking-reduced/) (cold battery or full charge)

Because of this, Tesla brake pads can last **100,000+ miles** for many drivers—compared to 30,000-50,000 miles on typical gas cars.

## When to Replace Tesla Brake Pads

Signs your brake pads need replacement:

- **Squealing or squeaking** when braking (see our [squeaky brakes guide](/posts/tesla-squeaky-brakes-fix/) for quick fixes before replacing)
- **Grinding noise** (urgent—you may be damaging rotors)
- **Visible wear indicator** on the pad (less than 3mm remaining)
- **Longer stopping distance**
- **Brake warning on screen** (rare, but possible)

<div class="info-box">
<strong>How to Check:</strong> You can visually inspect brake pads through the wheel spokes. The pad material should be at least 3-4mm thick. If you see bare metal or hear metal-on-metal, stop driving and replace immediately.
</div>

## What You'll Need

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours (for all four wheels)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate (if you've changed brakes before, this is similar)

**Brake Pads to Buy:**

Tesla uses standard brake components. You don't need to buy from Tesla. Compatible options include:

- **OEM Tesla pads** (~$60-80/axle)
- **Bosch QuietCast** (~$40-60/axle) - Great value
- **Akebono ProACT** (~$50-70/axle) - Ceramic, low dust
- **EBC Red Stuff** (~$80-100/axle) - Performance upgrade

## Step-by-Step Brake Pad Replacement

### Preparation

1. Park on a flat, level surface
2. Put the car in "Jack Mode" (Controls > Service > Jack Mode)
3. Gather all tools and have new pads ready
4. Make sure the car is off and won't go to sleep during the repair

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Always use jack stands. Never work under a car supported only by a jack. Tesla vehicles are heavy—a Model 3 weighs over 4,000 lbs.
</div>

### Lifting the Vehicle

1. Locate the **jack points** on your Tesla (reinforced areas on the frame)
   - Model 3/Y: Just behind the front wheels and just in front of the rear wheels
   - Model S/X: Similar positions, check owner's manual for exact locations
2. Use a jack pad or Tesla-specific puck to protect the battery
3. Lift the car and secure on jack stands
4. Remove the wheel (21mm lug nuts on most models)

### Removing Old Brake Pads

**Front Brakes:**

1. Locate the caliper on the rotor
2. Find the two caliper slide bolts (usually 13mm or 14mm) on the back
3. Remove the lower bolt only (this allows the caliper to swing up)
4. Swing the caliper up and support it with a wire or bungee—**never let it hang by the brake hose**
5. Slide out the old brake pads

**Rear Brakes:**

The process is similar, but rear calipers on Teslas may have an **electronic parking brake**. You may need to:

1. Release the electronic parking brake before starting
2. Use a brake caliper tool to retract the piston (they screw in, not push in)
3. Some Model 3/Y rear calipers have a specific procedure—check the service manual

### Compressing the Caliper Piston

Before installing new pads, you need to push the caliper piston back in to make room for the thicker new pads.

**Front brakes:** Use a C-clamp or brake piston tool to push the piston straight in

**Rear brakes:** Use a brake caliper wind-back tool—the piston rotates as it retracts

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Open the brake fluid reservoir cap before compressing pistons. This prevents pressure buildup. Close it when done.
</div>

### Installing New Brake Pads

1. Apply brake pad grease to the back of the new pads and the contact points on the caliper bracket
2. Install the new pads into the caliper bracket
3. Swing the caliper back down over the pads
4. Reinstall the caliper bolt and torque to spec (typically 25-30 ft-lbs)
5. Reinstall the wheel and torque lug nuts in a star pattern (129 ft-lbs for most Teslas)

### Bed-In Procedure

New brake pads need to be "bedded in" for optimal performance:

1. Drive at 35 mph and brake firmly (but not to a complete stop) down to 5 mph
2. Repeat 5-6 times with short cooling periods
3. Drive at 45 mph and brake firmly down to 5 mph
4. Repeat 3-4 times
5. Drive for 5-10 minutes with minimal braking to cool the brakes

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Front + Rear | Labor |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Tesla Service Center | $300-500+ | Included |
| Independent Shop | $200-350 | Included |
| DIY (Quality Pads) | $80-150 | Your time |

**Your savings: $150-350+**

## Common Questions

**Do I need to replace rotors too?**
Not usually. Tesla rotors last 100,000+ miles for most drivers. Check for grooves, cracks, or minimum thickness specifications.

**Can I do just the fronts or rears?**
Yes, you can do one axle at a time. Most wear happens on the front brakes.

**Do I need to bleed the brakes?**
No, a pad replacement doesn't require bleeding unless you open the brake lines.

**Will this affect my warranty?**
No, DIY brake pad replacement doesn't void any warranty. It's a standard maintenance item.

*This is one of the most satisfying DIY repairs because the savings are significant and the process is straightforward once you've done it once.*
