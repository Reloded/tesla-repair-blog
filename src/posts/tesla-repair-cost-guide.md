Tesla service centers are convenient, but they're not cheap. A simple brake pad swap can run $300-500 at the dealer when you can do it yourself for $50-80 in parts. Multiply that across every maintenance item and repair over your ownership period, and DIY saves you thousands.

This guide breaks down what every major Tesla repair costs at the dealer versus doing it yourself, along with difficulty ratings and links to our step-by-step guides.

## How to Use This Guide

- **Dealer Cost** = typical Tesla Service Center or third-party shop price (parts + labor)
- **DIY Cost** = parts only, sourced online
- **Difficulty** = Easy (no experience needed), Intermediate (basic tools + some confidence), Advanced (significant mechanical skill)
- All prices are approximate and vary by region and model

## 🛞 Brakes

Teslas use regenerative braking, so brake components last much longer than gas cars—but they still wear out eventually. These are some of the most rewarding DIY jobs because the dealer markup on labor is huge.

## Where to Buy Parts

For Tesla-specific parts and tools, check our [Tesla parts buying guide for Europe](/posts/tesla-parts-europe-buying-guide/) which covers the best suppliers, OEM vs aftermarket quality, and shipping tips.

**Top sources:**
- **Tesla Online Shop** — OEM parts, sometimes overpriced
- **Amazon** — Wide selection, fast shipping, easy returns
- **eBay** — Good for used OEM parts
- **AliExpress** — Budget options, longer shipping
- **RockAuto** — Great for brake and suspension parts
- **EVANNEX / Abstract Ocean** — Tesla-specific accessories

## Before You Start

1. **Get the right tools.** A basic toolkit, floor jack, and jack stands cover 80% of the repairs on this page. See our tool recommendations at the top.
2. **Know your model year.** Parts and procedures vary between Model 3/Y and Model S/X, and even between production years.
3. **Put the car in Jack Mode.** Always enable Jack Mode in the service menu before lifting your Tesla. Our [lifting guide](/posts/tesla-jack-points-lifting-guide/) covers this.
4. **Start easy.** If you've never worked on a car, begin with cabin filter, tire rotation, or wiper blades. Build confidence before tackling brakes or suspension.
5. **Document everything.** Take photos before and during disassembly. Your future self will thank you.
